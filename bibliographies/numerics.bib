@article{floria1995universal,
	abstract = {Within the framework of the elliptic two-body problem, Nacozy (1977) defined and integrated a Sundman-type transformation of the time variable. The new independent variable tau introduced through this device was termed the intermediate anomaly of Keplerian motion. We propose a general and systematic derivation of this kind of anomaly within a universal formulation and representation of the two-body problem, and Nacozy`s developments are thus generalized and adapted to yield a uniform treatment of Kepler motion. To this end, an essential analytical tool is provided by certain classes of special functions, the so-called universal functions and Stumpff c-functions.},

@article{carlson1970hidden,
	abstract = {Several familiar special functions possess a hidden permutation symmetry which accounts for some of their transformation properties. For example the transformation of the elliptic integral  into  expresses the symmetry of an integral representing Gauss' arithmetic-geometric mean of two variables. Likewise, a transformation of the hypergeometric function  with argument z into the same function with argument  can be viewed as a symmetry under interchange of two variables, but in this case two parameters must be interchanged as well. A similar remark applies to Kummer's transformation of the confluent hypergeometric function. The five transformations which change the modulus k of an incomplete elliptic integral into , , , , and  are equivalent to the five nontrivial permutations of three variables, and the theory of elliptic integrals can be simplified by choosing standard integrals which are explicitly symmetric. Appell's double hypergeometric function  has a partly concealed symmetry under simultaneous permutations of three parameters and three variables. The feature common to all these examples is a function  which is symmetric in the indices  of the parameters b and variables z and represents a weighted average of a function of one variable over the convex hull of . The advantage of using explicitly symmetric functions is illustrated by generalizing Borchardt's iterative algorithm for computing an inverse cosine to an algorithm for computing an inverse elliptic cosine.},

Reduction formulas, used to express many elliptic integrals in terms of a few standard integrals, are simplified by modifying the definition of intermediate ``basic integrals.'' 2. A faster than quadratically convergent series is given for numerical computation of the complete symmetric elliptic integral of the third kind. 3. A series expansion of an elliptic or hyperelliptic integral in elementary symmetric functions is given, illustrated with numerical coefficients for terms through degree seven for the symmetric elliptic integral of the first kind. Its usefulness for elliptic integrals, in particular, is important.},

@article{fukushima2009fast,
	abstract = {As a preparation step to compute Jacobian elliptic functions efficiently, we created a fast method to calculate the complete elliptic integral of the first and second kinds, K(m) and E(m), for the standard domain of the elliptic parameter, 0 < m < 1. For the case 0 < m < 0.9, the method utilizes 10 pairs of approximate polynomials of the order of 9--19 obtained by truncating Taylor series expansions of the integrals. Otherwise, the associate integrals, K(1 − m) and E(1 − m), are first computed by a pair of the approximate polynomials and then transformed to K(m) and E(m) by means of Jacobi's nome, q, and Legendre's identity relation. In average, the new method runs more-than-twice faster than the existing methods including Cody's Chebyshev polynomial approximation of Hastings type and Innes' formulation based on q-series expansions. Next, we invented a fast procedure to compute simultaneously three Jacobian elliptic functions, sn(u|m), cn(u|m), and dn(u|m), by repeated usage of the double argument formulae starting from the Maclaurin series expansions with respect to the elliptic argument, u, after its domain is reduced to the standard range, 0 ≤ u < K(m)/4, with the help of the new method to compute K(m). The new procedure is 25--70% faster than the methods based on the Gauss transformation such as Bulirsch's algorithm, sncndn, quoted in the Numerical Recipes even if the acceleration of computation of K(m) is not taken into account.},

@article{fukushima2012series,
	abstract = {Based on general discussion of series expansions of Carlson's symmetric elliptic integrals, we developed fifteen kinds of them including eleven new ones by utilizing the symmetric nature of the integrals. Thanks to the special addition formulas of the integrals, we also obtained their complementary series expansions. By considering the balance between the speed of convergence and the amount of computational labor, we chose four of them as the best series expansions. Practical evaluation of the integrals is conducted by the most suitable one among these four series expansions. Its selection rule was analytically specified in terms of the numerical values of given parameters. As a by-product, we obtained an efficient asymptotic expansion of the integrals around their logarithmic singularities. Numerical experiments confirmed the effectiveness of these new series expansions. References},

	abstract = {Logarithms, arctangents, and elliptic integrals of all three kinds (including complete integrals) are evaluated numerically by successive applications of the duplication theorem. When the convergence is improved by including a fixed number of terms of Taylor's series, the error ultimately decreases by a factor of 4096 in each cycle of iteration. Except for Cauchy principal values there is no separation of cases according to the values of the variables, and no serious cancellations occur if the variables are real and nonnegative. Only rational operations and square roots are required. An appendix contains a recurrence relation and two new representations (in terms of elementary symmetric functions and power sums) forR-polynomials, as well as an upper bound for the error made in truncating the Taylor series of anR-function.},
