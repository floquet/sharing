@article{hanspeter2003analytical,
	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of dynamics of space systems, starting with the fundamentals and covering topics from basic kinematics and dynamics to more advanced celestial mechanics. All material is presented in a consistent manner, and the reader is guided through the various derivations and proofs in a tutorial way. Cookbook formulas are avoided; instead, the reader is led to understand the principles underlying the equations at issue, and shown how to apply them to various dynamical systems. The book is divided into two parts. Part I covers analytical treatment of topics such as basic dynamic principles up to advanced energy concepts. Special attention is paid to the use of rotating reference frames that often occur in aerospace systems. Part II covers basic celestial mechanics, treating the two-body problem, restricted three-body problem, gravity field modeling, perturbation methods, spacecraft formation flying, and orbit transfers. MATLAB{\textregistered}, Mathematica{\textregistered} and C-Code toolboxes are provided for the rigid body kinematics routines discussed in chapter 3, and the basic orbital 2-body orbital mechanics routines discussed in chapter 9. A solutions manual is also available for professors. MATLAB{\textregistered} is a registered trademark of The MathWorks, Inc.; Mathematica{\textregistered} is a registered trademark of Wolfram Research, Inc.},

	abstract = {Parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES) is an important tool in the codesign of extreme-scale systems because PDES provides a cost-effective way to evaluate designs of highperformance computing systems. Optimistic synchronization algorithms for PDES, such as Time Warp, allow events to be processed without global synchronization among the processing elements. A rollback mechanism is provided when events are processed out of timestamp order. Although optimistic synchronization protocols enable the scalability of large-scale PDES, the performance of the simulations must be tuned to reduce the number of rollbacks and provide an improved simulation runtime. To enable efficient large-scale optimistic simulations, one has to gain insight into the factors that affect the rollback behavior and simulation performance. We developed a tool for ROSS model developers that gives them detailed metrics on the performance of their large-scale optimistic simulations at varying levels of simulation granularity. Model developers can use this information for parameter tuning of optimistic simulations in order to achieve better runtime and fewer rollbacks. In this work, we instrument the ROSS optimistic PDES framework to gather detailed statistics
about the simulation engine. We have also developed an interactive visualization interface that uses the data collected by the ROSS instrumentation to understand the underlying behavior of the simulation engine. The interface connects real time to virtual
time in the simulation and provides the ability to view simulation data at different granularities. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by performing a visual analysis of the dragonfly network topology model provided by the CODES simulation
framework built on top of ROSS. The instrumentation needs to minimize overhead in order to accurately collect data about the simulation performance. To ensure that the instrumentation does not introduce unnecessary overhead, we perform a scaling
study that compares instrumented ROSS simulations with their noninstrumented counterparts in order to determine the amount of perturbation when running at different simulation scales.},

of this thesis. Two traditional algorithms, one being conservative and other being optimistic, for parallel discrete event simulation have been implemented on GPUs using CUDA. The first algorithm is the safe-window algorithm (conservative). It has produced expected performance when compared to sequential simulation. The second algorithm, known as SyncSim, is an optimistic simulation algorithm previously designed to be space efficient and reduce rollbacks. This algorithm is re-implemented on GPU platform with necessary changes on the logic simulator and the parallel heap implementation. The performance of the parallel heap when working with a logic simulator has also been validated against the results indicated in previous research paper on parallel heap without the logic simulator},

	abstract = {Synchronous Parallel Environment for Emulation and Discrete-Event Simulation (SPEEDES) is a unified parallel simulation environment. It supports multiple-synchronization protocols without requiring users to recompile their code. When a SPEEDES simulation runs on one node, all the extra parallel overhead is removed automatically at run time. When the same executable runs in parallel, the user preselects the synchronization algorithm from a list of options. SPEEDES currently runs on UNIX networks and on the California Institute of Technology/Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mark III Hypercube. SPEEDES also supports interactive simulations. Featured in the SPEEDES environment is a new parallel synchronization approach called Breathing Time Buckets. This algorithm uses some of the conservative techniques found in Time Bucket synchronization, along with the optimism that characterizes the Time Warp approach. A mathematical model derived from first principles predicts the performance of Breathing Time Buckets. Along with the Breathing Time Buckets algorithm, this paper discusses the rules for processing events in SPEEDES, describes the implementation of various other synchronization protocols supported by SPEEDES, describes some new ones for the future, discusses interactive simulations, and then gives some performance results. },

@book{analyticMechanics,
	abstract = {Analytical Mechanics, first published in 1999, provides a detailed introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and prepares the reader thoroughly for further study at graduate level. The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics early on in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations, nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature is the inclusion of many 'e-mail questions', which are intended to facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. Many worked examples are given, and there are 250 homework exercises to help students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics, and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.},

	abstract = {In 1976 't Hooft introduced an elegant approach towards understanding the physical consequences of the topological structures that appear in non-Abelian gauge theories. These effects are concisely summarized in terms of an effective multi-fermion interaction. These old arguments provide a link between a variety of recent and sometimes controversial ideas including discrete chiral symmetries appearing in some models for unification, ambiguities in the definition of quark masses, and flaws with some simulation algorithms in lattice gauge theory.},

	abstract = {Quarkonium has been proposed as a sensitive probe of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) more than thirty years ago. Since then, lots of experimental efforts have been devoted to study its production in heavy-ion collisions to search for QGP and study its properties and significant progresses have been made. In this paper, an overview of recent experimental results on charmonium and bottomonium production in heavy-ion collisions as well as in small systems are presented. Furthermore, the results on exotic particle X(3872) production in Pb+Pb and p+p collisions are also discussed.},

Among applications of this problem is the calibration of covariance matrices. We propose a Lagrangian dualization of this least-squares problem, which leads us to a convex differentiable dual problem. We propose to solve the latter problem with a quasi-Newton algorithm. We assess this approach with numerical experiments which show that fairly large problems can be solved efficiently. },

@article{doi:10.1137/040609902,
	abstract = { We consider the problem of finding the smallest adjustment to a given symmetric \$n \times n\$ matrix, as measured by the Euclidean or Frobenius norm, so that it satisfies some given linear equalities and inequalities, and in addition is positive semidefinite. This least-squares covariance adjustment problem is a convex optimization problem, and can be efficiently solved using standard methods when the number of variables (i.e., entries in the matrix) is modest, say, under \$1000\$. Since the number of variables is \$n(n+1)/2\$, this corresponds to a limit around \$n=45\$. Malick [{\it SIAM J. Matrix Anal.\ Appl.,} 26 (2005), pp. 272--284] studies a closely related problem and calls it the semidefinite least-squares problem. In this paper we formulate a dual problem that has no matrix inequality or matrix variables, and a number of (scalar) variables equal to the number of equality and inequality constraints in the original least-squares covariance adjustment problem. This dual problem allows us to solve far larger least-squares covariance adjustment problems than would be possible using standard methods. Assuming a modest number of constraints, problems with \$n=1000\$ are readily solved by the dual method. The dual method coincides with the dual method proposed by Malick when there are no inequality constraints and can be obtained as an extension of his dual method when there are inequality constraints. Using the dual problem, we show that in many cases the optimal solution is a low rank update of the original matrix.

We show that by using a high-quality implementation of one of these techniques, we obtain a solver that performs extremely well in the traditional yardsticks of numerical linear algebra: it is significantly faster than high-performance implementations of existing state-of-the-art algorithms, and it is numerically backward stable. More specifically, we describe a least-squares solver for dense highly overdetermined systems that achieves residuals similar to those of direct QR factorization-based solvers (lapack), outperforms lapack by large factors, and scales significantly better than any QR-based solver. },

	abstract = {Large space structures would exhibit orbit-attitude-structure-thermal coupled effects in complicated space environment. Thus, a new thermal-structure coupled modelling method is proposed using gradient-deficient absolute nodal coordinate formulation beam elements. Compared to the previous methods, both axial and circumferential heat conduction are considered. The cubic interpolation in temperature field instead of the linear interpolation is adopted to obtain a unified-mesh temperature-displacement description. The gravitational force and gravity gradient are modelled, and the effects of attitude motion and structural deformation on solar radiation intensity are considered. In addition, three kinds of quasi-static thermal-structure coupled models are proposed based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Based on the quasi-static models, the theoretical formulas are derived to effectively predict the thermally induced vibrations of the beam in space. Four numerical examples are studied to validate the proposed models, including the heat conduction examples with three boundary conditions and a thermal-structure coupled cantilever beam example. Based on the proposed formulation, the orbit-attitude-structure-thermal coupled dynamics of a multibody system consisted of a rigid body and a large flexible appendage is investigated considering the gravity gradient, solar radiation, Earth's shadow, and self-shadow.},

	abstract = {The mechanism that forms the different resonant families of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars is not completely understood. To study the resonant capture mechanism and the origin of orbits of some asteroid families in mean motion resonances with Jupiter, furthermore to give a possible explanation of this problem, we performed in situ numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional semi-analytical model of the Sun-Jupiter-particle system. We examined the numbers and orbits of particles captured along the Jupiter's present orbit (including the L3, L4 and L5 Lagrange points) for 7000 Jupiter years. In our simulations we did not distinguish between planetesimals, interplanetary dust and asteroids, because we investigated the restricted three-body problem taking into account only gravitation. We found that the asteroid families in 4:3, 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 5:8, 4:7 and 5:9 resonances may have formed from the asteroids captured, launched and kept on their orbits not only by the L4 and L5 points, but also by the unstable L3 point and certain areas along the Jupiter's path. Furthermore, we found possible new asteroid families in 4:5 and 3:4 resonances, no any member of which have yet been identified. Thus, Jupiter forms a shield which protects the inner Solar System from asteroids moving with speeds not significantly differing from that of Jupiter.},

	abstract = {Classical methods for initial orbit determination (IOD) include Laplace method, Gauss method, and their variations. In addition to this, based on the characteristic of optical observation data nowadays, experts propose some other IOD methods, like Double-r method and admissible region method. One of the ways to determinate the orbit through double-r method is to guess distances of the target from the observer at two epochs---usually at the first and the last one. By doing so, we can solve the Lambert problem, and use its solution as the initial guess of the orbit. Furthermore, we can improve the initial guess by iterations to reduce the root mean square (RMS) of the observations. The admissible method is based on the concept of attributable (longitude, latitude, and their rates). With some conceptions, the admissible region described by the range and range rate from the observer is characterized. Using triangulation we can find the nodal point that makes the RMS minimal. In our work, we apply one intelligent optimization method---the particle swarm optimization method to the two methods, based on simulated and real data, and compare the results with that of modified Laplace method. At last, we briefly discuss the possibility of applying the double-r method to the orbit link problem.},

	abstract = {Grazing, which can induce many nonclassical bifurcations, is a special dynamic phenomenon in some non-smooth dynamical systems such as vibro-impact systems with clearance. In this paper, the existence and stability of the periodic orbits induced by the grazing bifurcation in a cantilever beam system with impacts are uncovered. Firstly, the Poincar{\'e} mapping of the system is obtained by adopting the discontinuous mapping method. Then, by means of shooting method, the periodic orbits are determined, followed by the acquisition of Jacobian matrix in the case of non-impact is obtained subsequently. In addition, for various impacting patterns, a combination of inhomogeneous equations and inequations is obtained to determine the existence of period orbits after grazing, with the stability criterion of the grazing-induced periodic orbits given. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis. What is more, we also give a conjecture about the relationship between eigenvalues and the type of periodic orbits when eigenvalues are imaginary numbers.},

	abstract = {Autonomous and magnetometer-based orbit determination algorithm in target pointing satellite based solely on magnetometer measurements for speeding up filter convergence is proposed. The cosine angle between geomagnetic field vector and target direction vector, as viewed from the satellite, provides some quantity that is sensitive to satellite position, more regular and periodical than the magnetic field magnitude as a satellite moves around its orbit, and easily observable from magnetometers. An algorithm is formulated by applying the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based on the laws of orbital mechanics, the measurement models of geomagnetic field magnitude and the cosine angle. The algorithm is tested and verified by using real-flight data obtained from Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-1 (KOMPSAT-1) and Magnetic Field Satellite (MAGSAT). The results obtained from numerical simulations using KOMPSAT-1 and MAGSAT data illustrate the significant convergence speed up and the robustness against both noise and bias of magnetic measurements. The proposed orbit determination is adequate as a primary routine for a target pointing satellite mission that requires fast convergence. Otherwise, it is sufficient as a secondary routine to provide redundancy.},

	abstract = {The old quantum theory and Schr{\"o}dinger׳s wave mechanics (and other forms of quantum mechanics) give the same results for the line splittings in the first-order Stark effect in hydrogen, the leading terms in the splitting of the spectral lines emitted by a hydrogen atom in an external electric field. We examine the account of the effect in the old quantum theory, which was hailed as a major success of that theory, from the point of view of wave mechanics. First, we show how the new quantum mechanics solves a fundamental problem that one runs into in the old quantum theory with the Stark effect. It turns out that, even without an external field, it depends on the coordinates in which the quantum conditions are imposed which electron orbits are allowed in a hydrogen atom. The allowed energy levels and hence the line splittings are independent of the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the orbits are not. In the new quantum theory, this worrisome non-uniqueness of orbits turns into the perfectly innocuous non-uniqueness of bases in Hilbert space. Second, we review how the so-called WKB (Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin) approximation method for solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation reproduces the quantum conditions of the old quantum theory amended by some additional half-integer terms. These extra terms remove the need for some arbitrary extra restrictions on the allowed orbits that the old quantum theory required over and above the basic quantum conditions.},

To achieve this objective, we conduct a comprehensive survey by systematically classifying the initial conditions of trajectories and scanning the phase space using two-dimensional (2D) maps on various planes. We then numerically integrate the starting conditions on these maps and classify the final states of the test particles as either bounded or unbounded. Bounded orbits are further subclassified as collision orbits and regular (or chaotic), while unbounded orbits are sub-classified according to the sector of the (x,y) plane through which the particle escapes the potential well. Our results reveal that increasing values of the oblateness coefficient reduce the number of escaping orbits and limit the extension of islands of regular motion (in the Liouville--Arnold sense). Regular bounded motion occurs only at larger distances from the secondary body.},

The proposed methodology integrates predictive control with a reduction method, aiming for optimality while addressing performance and system constraints. Formulating the control problem as a quadratic program, the predictive control method generates a sequence of control inputs using a reducing horizon strategy. Stability analysis, employing Lyapunov-Krasovsky functions and linear matrix inequalities, yields delay-independent conditions for exponential convergence.

	abstract = { Abstract. We propose a scheme for data-driven parameterization of unresolved dimensions of dynamical systems based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining a surrogate system in a time-dependent quantum state which determines the fluxes from the unresolved degrees of freedom at each timestep. The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes' law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 multiscale systems and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic dynamics. },

	abstract = { Abstract. We consider the fluid-structure interaction of viscoelastic solids and Stokesian multiphase fluid flows with moving capillary interfaces and investigate the impact of moving contact lines. Thermodynamic consistency of Lagrangian diffuse and sharp-interface models is ensured even on the discrete level by providing a monolithic incremental time discretization and a finite element space discretization. We numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero, \(\varepsilon \to 0\), and investigate scalings of the Cahn--Hilliard mobility \(m(\varepsilon )=m\_0\varepsilon^\alpha\) for \(0\le \alpha \le \infty\). In the presence of interfaces, certain sharp-interface limits are only valid for an interval \(\underline{\alpha }\lt \alpha \lt \overline{\alpha }\), i.e., there is an upper and lower bound on the range of valid scaling exponents \(\alpha\). We show that with moving contact lines scaling is more restrictive since \(\alpha \approx \underline{\alpha }\) causes significant errors due to excess diffusion. Similarly, we demonstrate that \(\alpha \gt \bar \alpha\) leads to nonconvergence to the sharp-interface limit. We propose \(2\le \alpha \le 5/2\) as a range of exponents that ensure optimal convergence of the phase field dynamics towards the sharp interface dynamics as \(\varepsilon \to 0\). },

A variable-length pendulum model is employed to describe the purely out-of-plane tether deployment dynamics, from which an analytical tether deployment control law is derived. The stability condition of the analytical control law is examined by Floquet theory. The corresponding analytical deployment law is asymptotically stable, and the requirement for a positive tension control input is guaranteed to ensure the controllability of the tether system. Following deployment, the critical conditions for the out-of-plane libration of the tethered subsatellite to become chaotic during the station-keeping phase are examined. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed approach can effectively and rapidly identify periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions using bifurcation diagrams, which provides valuable insights for enhancing the stability and reliability of such tethered satellite systems.},

	abstract = {For non-cooperative large tumbling space debris, the use of detumbling techniques to reduce its angular velocity facilitates capturing and deorbiting operations. In our recent work, a new detumbling device combining three harpoons and a nanosatellite was designed. The device is released from the servicing satellite and attaches to the surface of the target. Then, the device's thrusters are actuated to reduce the target's angular velocity. In this paper, the dynamics and control issues involved in this strategy are further investigated. The collision model between the detumbling device and the target in the process of attachment is built based on the principle of momentum conservation. A high-precision orbit-attitude coupled dynamics model of the combined system during the detumbling mission is established, in which major external disturbances as well as inertial parameter variations due to the fuel consumption of the nanosatellite are taken into account. In addition, an adaptive sliding mode control scheme incorporating pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulation is proposed for debris targets with parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the detumbling control scheme are demonstrated by numerical simulations. The results show that the detumbling device is capable of detumbling a large tumbling rocket upper stage within 4000s.},

	abstract = {The author determines all spherically symmetric and static Lorentzian spacetimes in which any bounded trajectory is periodic. The author calls such spacetimes 'Bertrand spacetimes', thereby referring to Bertrand's classical theorem which deals with the analogous situation in Newtonian mechanics. Any Bertrand spacetime is characterized by a rational number beta which gives the apsidal angle of all bounded trajectories in fractions of pi . Whereas Newtonian Bertrand potentials exist only for beta =1 (Kepler potential) and for beta =2 (harmonic oscillator potential), general relativity allows one to construct Bertrand spacetimes for any beta . An asymptotically Minkowskian Bertrand spacetime, however, must have beta =1, and a Bertrand spacetime with regular centre must have beta =2. Whereas all asymptotically Minkowskian Bertrand spacetimes violate the weak energy condition, some Bertrand spacetimes with regular centre admit an interpretation as charged perfect fluid solution of Einstein's field equation.},

But in the decades since, around 10,000 of these films sat idle, scattered across the country in high-security vaults. Not only were they gathering dust, the film material itself was slowly decomposing, bringing the data they contained to the brink of being lost forever. For the past five years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) weapon physicist Greg Spriggs and a crack team of film experts, archivists and software developers have been on a mission to hunt down, scan, reanalyze and declassify these decomposing films. The goals are to preserve the films' content before it's lost forever, and provide better data to the post-testing-era scientists who use computer codes to help certify that the aging U.S. nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective.},

This has come in part from the series of atmospheric tests, including several at very high altitudes, conducted in the Pacific Ocean area in 1962. In addition, laboratory studies, theoretical calculations, and computer simulations have provided a better understanding of the various effects. A new chapter has been added on the electromagnetic pulse. The chapter titles are as follows: general principles of nuclear explosions; descriptions of nuclear explosions; air blast phenomena in air and surface bursts; air blast loading; structural damage from air blast; shock effects of surface and subsurface bursts; thermal radiation and its effects; initial nuclear radiation; residual nuclear radiation and fallout; radio and radar effects; the electromagnetic pulse and its effects; and biological effects.

@article{osti_1171337,
	abstractnote = {A computational study was performed to examine the differences in near-surface ground-waves and air-blast waves generated by high-explosive energy sources and those generated by much higher energy - density low - yield nuclear sources. The study examined the effect of explosive-source emplacement (i.e., height-of-burst, HOB, or depth-of-burial, DOB) over a range from depths of -35m to heights of 20m, for explosions with an explosive yield of 1-kt . The chemical explosive was modeled by a JWL equation-of-state model for a ~14m diameter sphere of ANFO (~1,200,000kg -- 1 k t equivalent yield ), and the high-energy-density source was modeled as a one tonne (1000 kg) plasma of `Iron-gas' (utilizing LLNL's tabular equation-of-state database, LEOS) in a 2m diameter sphere, with a total internal-energy content equivalent to 1 k t . A consistent equivalent-yield coupling-factor approach was developed to compare the behavior of the two sources. The results indicate that the equivalent-yield coupling-factor for air-blasts from 1 k t ANFO explosions varies monotonically and continuously from a nearly perfec t reflected wave off of the ground surface for a HOB ≈ 20m, to a coupling factor of nearly zero at DOB ≈ -25m. The nuclear air - blast coupling curve, on the other hand, remained nearly equal to a perfectly reflected wave all the way down to HOB's very near zero, and then quickly dropped to a value near zero for explosions with a DOB ≈ -10m. The near - surface ground - wave traveling horizontally out from the explosive source region to distances of 100's of meters exhibited equivalent - yield coupling - factors t hat varied nearly linearly with HOB/DOB for the simulated ANFO explosive source, going from a value near zero at HOB ≈ 5m to nearly one at DOB ≈ -25m. The nuclear-source generated near-surface ground wave coupling-factor remained near zero for almost all HOB's greater than zero, and then appeared to vary nearly - linearly with depth-of-burial until it reached a value of one at a DOB between 15m and 20m. These simulations confirm the expected result that the variation of coupling to the ground, or the air, change s much more rapidly with emplacement location for a high-energy-density (i.e., nuclear-like) explosive source than it does for relatively low - energy - density chemical explosive sources. The Energy Partitioning, Energy Coupling (EPEC) platform at LLNL utilizes laser energy from one quad (i.e. 4-laser beams) of the 192 - beam NIF Laser bank to deliver ~10kJ of energy to 1mg of silver in a hohlraum creating an effective small-explosive `source' with an energy density comparable to those in low-yield nuclear devices. Such experiments have the potential to provide direct experimental confirmation of the simulation results obtained in this study, at a physical scale (and time-scale) which is a factor of 1000 smaller than the spatial- or temporal-scales typically encountered when dealing with nuclear explosions.},

The Beirut explosion is again a very sad event with disastrous consequences, but it is not a surprise in the sense of a new phenomenon. It is tragic that calamities with AN occur despite ample guidelines for prevention. Knowledge of the decomposition of AN over the years has greatly progressed, as well how to initiate a detonation with a strong shock wave from a high explosive charge. However, to reproduce the initiation of a detonation by a fire under controlled laboratory conditions never succeeded. The details of the transition of decomposing AN to a detonation remained an open question. Is it a deflagration to detonation mechanism, or is it a shock to detonation one? Knowledge of this may further help process safety measures for the product. The paper will bring research contributions from over a century together, it will develop a scenario how this disaster could happen in Beirut, how much of the AN contributed to the blast, and how further research effort could be beneficial. In addition, the paper estimates the TNT mass equivalent of the AN detonation in Beirut employing three different methods.},

@article{osti_1820053,
	abstractnote = {The study of nuclear forensics harkens back to the Manhattan Project-era, when scientists first started to analyze the debris from the 1945 Trinity test. Political turmoil stemming from the Cold War and the rehabilitation of Germany following WWII has led to new challenges in international security involving nuclear proliferation. Nuclear materials have, on occasion, been lost, misplaced, or stolen from former Soviet countries, and illicit materials have been interdicted all over the world. The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center (NTNFC) was established in 2006, and has been at the forefront of drive to advance nuclear forensic capabilities in the United States. The ultimate goal of nuclear forensics is to examine nuclear and other radioactive materials using analytical techniques to determine origin and history of the material, particularly in the context of law enforcement investigations. Nuclear forensics can be divided into two parts: predetonation and post-detonation. Pre-detonation forensics, as the name implies, is the investigation of a nuclear material or weapon that has not been detonated or involved in an explosion, whereas postdetonation forensics is the study of activation or fission products in debris or the environment following the use of a nuclear or radiological dispersal device (RDD). Both parts require a number of analytical chemical and radiochemical techniques to determine identification of the material. Many advancements in analytical techniques, including rapidity, sample size, and forensic signatures have been made in recent years. The analytical methods that can be used in a nuclear forensic investigation, such as mass spectrometry and gamma spectroscopy, have been described in detail in previous reviews, including Straub et.al, and will not be explained here. This review will discuss recent publications (from 2016 to present) describing advancements of techniques such as radiochronometry, morphology, development of novel reference materials, and inter-laboratory collaborations for both pre- and post-detonation nuclear forensics.},

	abstractnote = {Here, the long-lived fission product 151Sm (T1/2 ≈ 90 y) present in archived dissolved Trinity nuclear test debris samples was analyzed using liquid scintillation counting and the results were compared to the expected values based upon historical analysis results. The measured 151Sm activities were found to agree with the expected values within experimental error. This demonstration validates the use of this technique in situations where the sample is too old for traditional shorter half-life radioactive fission product signatures such as 99Mo (T1/2 = 2.75 d), 97Zr (T1/2 = 16.7 h), 147Nd (T1/2 = 10.98 d), and 153Sm (T1/2 = 46.3 h), or too dilute for determining fissions through stable isotope ratio measurements.},

This is about 40% of the radiochemically derived value of 25$\pm$2 kt that necessarily includes thermal and nuclear radiation that do not contribute to the blast. Although this story is classic, there appears to be no account of how he related his observation to the yield. This paper attempts to reconstruct how he might have done so.},

Roosevelt to begin the research on a nuclear bomb in 1941 to the last test conducted by the U.S. in 1992, the fifty-year history of the nuclear weapons testing program has been an expansive topic of research. The program's growth is credited to the race to build the first atomic weapon for war. The termination of the Soviet Union and many other factors, including concerns about the adverse health effects of radioactive fallout, influenced the decline of the need for the program. The discovery of the negative health effects caused by low-level radiation and the subsequent studies influenced sitting U.S. presidents in passing policies that significantly impacted the nuclear weapons testing program.},

	abstractnote = {In 1996, negotiations between the National Nuclear Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NNC), the U.S. Defense Special Weapons Administration (DSWA) and the U.S. Department of Energy led to an agreement for a joint series of experiments at the former Soviet nuclear test site Semipalatinsk (STS). These experiments had a dual purpose: to close holes and tunnels originally created for the purpose of testing nuclear weapons, and to characterize explosive sources at a former nuclear test site. This report covers the recovery of legacy data from the experiments conduct in 1997 and 1998. Two teams collected data. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), in collaboration with the NNC, collected the near-source (local) data out to approximately 20 km. Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), with funding from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (LLNL), also in collaboration with NNC, collected regional data, 200 -- 1000 km distant, leveraging the KZ regional seismic network that LDEO had recently installed in collaboration with NNC. The two teams also worked together to some extent, regarding instrumentation and planning. This report primarily addresses the near-source data collected by the LANL/NNC team.},

	abstractnote = {The analysis of seismic data for evidence of possible nuclear explosion testing is a critical global security mission that relies heavily on human expertise to identify and mark seismic signals embedded in background noise. To assist analysts in making these determinations, we adapted two compression distance metrics for use with seismic data. First, we demonstrated that the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) metric can be adapted for use with waveform data and can identify the arrival times of seismic signals. Then we tested an approximation for the NCD called Sliding Information Distance (SLID), which can be computed much faster than NCD. We assessed the accuracy of the SLID output by comparing it to both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the judgments of expert seismic analysts. Our results indicate that SLID effectively identifies arrival times and provides analysts with useful information that can aid their analysis process.},

	abstractnote = {Abstract Seismic observations of underground nuclear explosions provide crucial data on source yield and depth that cannot easily be estimated from other geophysical methods. However, it is difficult to obtain reliable yield estimates for test sites for which we do not have direct seismic calibration experiments. To obtain source information from uncalibrated sites and paths, local and regional seismic records of six, proximal, declared underground nuclear explosions in North Korea are used to compute spectral ratios of narrow‐band waveform envelopes of body‐wave coda that remove path and site effects to reveal precise, relative source moment. The yields of these explosions are obtained from the observed source ratios by simultaneously fitting the classical source model of Mueller and Murphy (1971), https://doi.org/10.1785/bssa0610061675 to all event pairs. The source model provides an impressive fit to the observations considering that the P phase coda derived source spectral ratios did not require a prior knowledge of the source or regionally calibrated corrections to be applied to the data. However, the observed corner frequencies from S wave coda spectral ratios are lower than the source model predictions, but are well fit by models calculated using the corner frequency consistent with the Fisk conjecture. The results presented here provide novel constraints on the spectral distributions of the energy radiated by the sources of the DPRK test series, and allows for an independent evaluation of existing estimated source model parameters.},

	abstractnote = {Abstract Vegetation has the potential to respond to underground nuclear explosions, yet these links have not been fully explored. Given the lack of previously described signatures, the changes in vegetation are possibly subtle. The integration of multiple different data streams is potentially a useful approach to improve signal detection. Here, we investigate whether semi‐arid vegetation growth patterns responded to eight legacy underground nuclear tests at the Nevada National Security Site in southern Nevada, USA. We tested for spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover, tree growth patterns, and tree leaf spectral properties using ground‐based measurements, including those from tree‐rings and hyperspectral surface vegetation reflectance, as well as space‐based measurements of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat. Multiple data streams suggest a localized (<1.2 km) spatial pattern whereby tree growth is enhanced closer to the source of the underground test relative to sites further away. We also observed a more regional (>1.2--9 km) pattern whereby tree growth is suppressed coincident with a drought beginning 1 year before the 1989 tests, but continuing in the 5 years following the tests, which is anomalous relative to what is expected based on the response of tree growth to previous droughts. Quantification of the relative effects of the tests on vegetation remains a challenge due to the coincident drought and the potential for other disturbances to have impacted tree growth at this time, but the integration of these data reveals a more nuanced growth response than any other one data set indicates alone.},

	abstractnote = {Underground nuclear explosions produce a broadband electromagnetic signal that can propagate to the surface at some distance. We perform a logistic regression on historical electromagnetic detections to calculate a probabilistic detection curve for prediction of the propagation distance for any given underground nuclear explosion. The curve predicts positive detections at scaled ranges of 2414.6, 2025.7, 1908.3, and 1672.4 m/ktonne1/3 at probabilities of 50, 90, 95 and 99%, respectively. For a theoretical 100 ktonne underground nuclear explosion these scaled ranges translate to absolute ranges of 11.2, 9.4, 8.9, and 7.8 km at probabilities of 50, 90, 95 and 99%, respectively. We also motivate a need for improved electromagnetic sensor design and deployment by extending the detection analysis using the quoted signal-to-noise ratio of two and noise amplitude of 10 pT along with attenuation relationships that go as 1/r to 1/r3. We find that reducing the noise floor by a factor often could extend the detection limit to approximately 5 to 25 km/ktonne1/3, which translates to 24 to 112 km for a theoretical 100 ktonne underground nuclear explosion.},

	abstractnote = {This paper summarizes recent above-ground nuclear explosion simulations as part of a broader effort to better characterize conditions within a fireball that may influence the chemical evolution of bomb materials and other materials entrained from the local explosion environment. A critical component of this work is validation against historic footage of atmospheric testing, requiring that we understand how the frequency-dependent sensitivity of the utilized film footage influences data captured in such images. We focus first on the early physics of a nuclear explosion in the atmosphere before discussing some of the technical challenges we seek to capture in late-time models that include more complex emplacement conditions and subsurface features. We discuss required physics packages (compressible hydrodynamics, radiation transport, as well as necessary ancillary tables such as equations of state (EOS) and opacities). Additionally, we note reasonable ``shortcuts'' one may make and their limitations, e.g., using ideal gas EOS, replacing spectrally resolved radiation with spectrally averaged radiation, and exchanging deterministic transport with diffusion. We then discuss an approach to achieving an equilibrated initial stress state for problems where buoyancy and subsurface lithostatic stress are important. Our methodology is presented in the context of LLNL's ALE3D multiphysics code but may readily be implemented in other codes. In this paper, we start with a description of the challenges of NUDET simulations, followed by a presentation of the simulated intensity (flux) as it would appear on an analysis of the Dixie test. We then progressively introduce additional complexity in subsequent sections (near-surface burst and gravity initialization) before concluding.},

The underground explosion produced substantial low-frequency atmospheric waves, which were detected by infrasound arrays located up to a distance of 566 km. These infrasound waves are formed by the conversion of seismic energy to acoustic energy across the lithosphere--atmosphere interface. While infrasound records at regional distances produce estimates of ground motion amplitude over spatially extended regions covering about 26 500 km2, 3-D full seismo-acoustic simulations within the lithosphere and atmosphere provide quantitative information about seismo-acoustic energy partitioning. Our results demonstrate the capability of remote infrasound observations combined with 3-D propagation modelling to further develop discrimination methods for underground sources. These results contribute to enhance the confidence of source identification and characterization in nuclear test monitoring research, which is essential for the enforcement of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.},

	abstractnote = {The Low-Yield Nuclear Monitoring (LYNM) Program is a long-term NNSA research and development effort designed to improve the United States' explosion monitoring capabilities, particularly with respect to low-yield and potentially evasive underground nuclear testing. The LYNM Program focuses on researching, discovering, and exploiting unique and useful signatures, from all available technologies and sensors (e.g., seismic, acoustic, electromagnetic, gases, and particulates (both stable and radioactive)). Four Department of Energy laboratories participate in LYNM and together are referred to as the `quad-lab'. The R&D program execution is performed under NNSA defined structures known as ``ventures''. Four science ventures were established: 1) Explosion Source Functions; 2) Containment of Low-Yield Underground Tests; 3) Local Signatures; 4) Dynamic Monitoring Networks. To organize and execute the large field scale experiment a fifth venture was established: 5) Physics Experiment One (PE-1). As part of the LYNM Program, a series of experiments are planned at various scales and levels of venture involvement. These vary from those that involve a subset of labs and/or LYNM ventures (e.g., small experiments), to full quad-lab LYNM Program field-scale integrated experiments. Such experiments may involve chemical explosions with tracer materials or other means of simulating the expected signals from a nuclear explosion. The LYNM Program does not conduct actual nuclear explosions. Since 1992, the U.S. has observed a moratorium on underground nuclear explosions. This document is intended to provide the underlying scientific basis for the LYNM planned experimental work. Each specific LYNM experiment will develop a goals, objectives, and requirements (GOR) plan following the guidance in this document. The LYNM technical staff will define the numbers and types of experiments required over the course of the Program based on technical needs and within funding constraints. As with any scientific experiment series, the number and types of experiments may change based upon the experimental results obtained. An experiment that agrees with models/codes/software signature predictions may need fewer repetitions/variations, depending upon the level of statistical rigor desired, as compared to one in which the predictions and experimental data do not match. The large LYNM field-scale integrated experiments require the longest lead-time for planning, and these are discussed in more detail near the end of this document.},

Here we report new independent absolute yield and depth of burial estimates of the North Korean nuclear tests which are commensurate with previously determined source parameters. The key advantage of this method over other methods which estimate absolute explosive yields is that this method does not require any a priori calibration, and can be immediately applied to any region of interest. This method uses the source information obtained from the spectral ratios of envelopes of measured seismic coda waves to invert for model-derived yield and depth of burial. The only requirements of this method are that the region of interest must contain several (> 3) seismic sources which have been well recorded (SNR > 2) by a set of shared stations.

STAX is an experiment to collect radioxenon emission data from industrial nuclear facilities with the goal of developing a better understanding of the global radioxenon background and the effect industrial radioxenon releases have on nuclear explosion monitoring. The final goal of this work is to utilize collected data along with atmospheric transport modeling to calculate the contribution of a peak or set of peaks detected by the International Monitoring System (IMS) to provide desired discriminating information to the International Data Centre (IDC) and National Data Centers (NDCs). Types of data received from the STAX equipment are shown and collected data was used for a case study to predict radioxenon concentrations at two IMS stations closest to the Institute for RadioElements (IRE) in Belgium. The initial evaluation of results indicate that the data is very valuable to the nuclear explosion monitoring community.},

	abstractnote = {Geophysical research on historical nuclear tests is an important aspect of future monitoring capabilities in seismic research. This research is challenging due to the limited number of digital seismic recordings during the peak of nuclear testing (1945-1992). These limited records are unique and non-reproducible data with potential high research impact. Releasing available nuclear explosion seismic records to the explosion monitoring community is thus of high value and is the motivation for this dataset release. The target of this effort was on compilation and quality control of regional seismic records of nuclear explosions recorded on Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory stations ELK, KNB, LAC, and MNV, known collectively as the Livermore National Network (LNN) (Figure 1). LNN was established in the early 1960s for the primary purpose of monitoring underground nuclear testing at the former Nevada Test Site (NTS), now known as the Nevada Nuclear Security Site (NNSS) following the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT). LNN consisted initially of short-period vertical component Benioff's recorded on film located at Mina, NV (MNV) and Kanab, Utah (KNB). LNN added two additional stations at Landers, CA (LAC) and Elko, NV (ELK) in 1967 and upgraded equipment to broadband seismometers recorded on frequency modulation (FM) tapes from 1967-1979, followed by digital recordings after 1979 (Jarpe, 1989). The digital recordings were on a variety of now obsolete media, including 9-track, Exabyte, and DAT tapes. Jarpe (1989) describes the seismic station instrumentation details over the period of deployment. LNN recorded valuable non-repeatable unique data of several hundreds of nuclear explosions at NNSS, as well as earthquakes and chemical and mining explosions (Walter, 2020). The details of these nuclear tests are provided in the Department of Energy Report NV-209 Rev 16 (DOE, 2015).},

We trained for three classes: earthquake P-wave, underground nuclear explosion (UNE) P-wave, and noise. With the current absence of nuclear testing by countries that have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, high quality seismic data from UNEs is limited. Even with limited training data, our model can accurately characterize most events recorded at regional and teleseismic distances, finding over 95% signals in the validation set. We applied the model on holdout datasets of the North Korean test explosions to evaluate the performance on unique region and station-source pairs, with promising results. Additionally, we tested on the Source Physics Experiment events to investigate the potential for chemical explosions to act as a surrogate for nuclear explosions. We anticipate that machine-learning models like our classifier system can have broad application for other seismic signals including volcanic and non-volcanic tremor, anomalous earthquakes, ice-quakes or landslide-quakes.},

@article{osti_1845378,
	abstractnote = {In 2010, nuclear weapon effects experts at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) were asked to provide a quick reference document containing estimated prompt nuclear effects. This report is an update to the 2010 document that includes updated model assumptions. This report addresses only the prompt effects associated with a nuclear detonation (e.g., blast, thermal fluence, and prompt ionizing radiation). The potential medium- and longer-term health effects associated with nuclear fallout are not considered in this report because, in part, of the impracticality of making generic estimates given the high dependency of fallout predictions on the local meteorological conditions at the time of the event. The results included in this report also do not consider the urban environment (e.g., shielding by or collapse of structures) which may affect the extent of prompt effects. It is important to note that any operational recommendations made using the estimates in this report are limited by the generic assumptions considered in the analysis and should not replace analyses made for a specific scenario/device. Furthermore, nuclear effects experts (John Hogan, SNL, and Byron Ristvet, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)) have indicated that the accuracy of effects predictions below 0.5 kilotons (kT) or 500 tons nuclear yield have greater uncertainty because of the limited data available for the prompt effects in this regime. The Specialized Hazard Assessment Response Capability (SHARC) effects prediction tool was used for these analyses. Specifically, the NUKE model within SHARC 2021 Version 10.2 was used. NUKE models only the prompt effects following a nuclear detonation. The algorithms for predicting range-to-output data contained within the NUKE model are primarily based on nuclear test effects data. Probits have been derived from nuclear test data and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protective action guides. Probits relate the probability of a hazard (e.g., fatality or injury) caused by a given insult (e.g., overpressure, thermal fluence, dose level). Several probits have been built into SHARC to determine the fatality and injury associated with a given level of insult. Some of these probits differ with varying yield. Such probits were used to develop the tables and plots in this report.},

	abstractnote = {Requirements for explosive safety are often given in terms of a ``K-Factor'', correlating incident blast effects with the distance and TNT equivalent weight of an explosion. Traditionally, this is conducted using empirical correlations to experimental measurements (e.g., the Kingery--Bulmash equations). In the far-field, empirical verification of incident overpressure and impulse magnitudes can be difficult; extrapolations from data give expected values at reasonable standoff distances that sometimes are too small to measure on available equipment but are larger than some regulations require. The present paper describes the results of numerical hydrocode analysis to verify the expected incident overpressure and impulse from small hemispherical ground charges of TNT at these relatively large distances. Furthermore, the dynamic effect of incident blast waves on lightweight, modular mitigation barriers is studied to gauge their effectiveness at providing safety standard compliance.},
