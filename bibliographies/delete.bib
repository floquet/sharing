	abstract = {It has been proved that the use of a vector Lyapunov function is more advantageous in certain situations rather than a scalar function. Moreover, each function needs to satisfy less rigid requirements. In this paper a new situation has been considered where vector Lyapunov functions play a further useful role. For this purpose, a new type of stability, namely, strict partial stability has been defined. The principal tool employed is the second method of Lyapunov and a comparison theorem of a more general type.},

	abstract = {We give several examples and examine case studies of linear stochastic functional differential equations. The examples fall into two broad classes: regular and singular, according to whether an underlying stochastic semiflow exists or not. In the singular case, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the maximal exponential growth rate λ̄1(σ) of the trajectories expressed in terms of the noise variance σ. Roughly speaking we show that for small σ, λ̄1(σ) behaves like -σ2/2, while for large σ, it grows like log σ. In the regular case, it is shown that a discrete Oseledec spectrum exists, and upper estimates on the top exponent λ1 are provided. These estimates are sharp in the sense that they reduce to known estimates in the deterministic or nondelay cases.},

	abstract = {This paper considers several methods for calculating low-rank approximate solutions to large-scale Lyapunov equations of the form AP + PA' + BB' = 0. The interest in this problem stems from model reduction where the task is to approximate high-dimensional models by ones of lower order. The two recently developed Krylov subspace methods exploited in this paper are the Arnoldi method [Saad, Math. Comput., 37 (1981), pp. 105-126] and the Generalised Minimum Residual method (GMRES) [Saad and Schultz, SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput., 7 (1986), pp. 856-869]. Exact expressions for the approximation errors incurred are derived in both cases. The numerical solution of the low-dimensional linear matrix equation arising from the GMRES method is discussed and an algorithm for its solution is proposed. Low rank solutions of discrete time Lyapunov equations and continuous time algebraic Riccati equations are also considered. Throughout this paper, the authors tackle problems in which B has more than one column with the use of block Krylov schemes.},

	abstract = {Different definitions of spectra have been proposed over the years to characterize the asymptotic behavior of nonautonomous linear systems. Here, we consider the spectrum based on exponential dichotomy of Sacker and Sell [J. Differential Equations, 7 (1978), pp. 320-358] and the spectrum defined in terms of upper and lower Lyapunov exponents. A main goal of ours is to understand to what extent these spectra are computable. By using an orthogonal change of variables transforming the system to upper triangular form, and the assumption of integral separation for the diagonal of the new triangular system, we justify how popular numerical methods, the so-called continuous QR and SVD approaches, can be used to approximate these spectra. We further discuss how to verify the property of integral separation, and hence how to a posteriori infer stability of the attained spectral information. Finally, we discuss the algorithms we have used to approximate the Lyapunov and Sacker-Sell spectra and present some numerical results.},
