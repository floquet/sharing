It is intended for upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students who need to develop parallel codes with little or no previous introduction to parallel computing. It is also intended as a reference manual for researchers active in the field of scientific computing. All the algorithms in the book are based on partition operators. These operators provide a unifying principle that fits seemingly disparate techniques into an overall framework for algorithm design. The book uses the co-array programming model to illustrate how to write code for concrete examples, but it emphasizes that the important concepts for algorithm design are independent of the programming model. With these concepts in mind, the reader can write algorithms in different programming models based on personal taste and comfort.},

It not only provides instructors with course material but also serves as a useful reference resource. Providing the detailed mathematical proofs behind the computational methods, this book appeals to undergraduate and graduate mathematics and engineering students.

@book{ray2019fortran,
	abstract = {The programming language Fortran dates back to 1957 when a team of IBM engineers released the first Fortran Compiler. During the past 60 years, the language had been revised and updated several times to incorporate more features to enable writing clean and structured computer programs. The present version is Fortran 2018. Since the dawn of the computer era, there had been a constant demand for a ``larger'' and ``faster'' machine. To increase the speed there are three hurdles. The density of the active components on a VLSI chip cannot be increased indefinitely and with the increase of the density heat dissipation becomes a major problem. Finally, the speed of any signal cannot exceed the velocity of the light. However, by using several inexpensive processors in parallel coupled with specialized software and hardware, programmers can achieve computing speed similar to a supercomputer. This book can be used to learn the modern Fortran from the beginning and the technique of developing parallel programs using Fortran. It is for anyone who wants to learn Fortran. Knowledge beyond high school mathematics is not required. There is not another book on the market yet which deals with Fortran 2018 as well as parallel programming.},

@book{metcalf2024modern,
	abstract = {Fortran remains one of the principal programming languages used in high-performance scientific, numerical, and engineering computing. A series of significant revisions to the standard versions of the language have progressively enhanced its capabilities, and the current standard-Fortran 2023-brings with it further additions and improvements. The language as defined by its most recent standards, with their introduction of object-oriented programming and of coarrays, is often referred to generically as' Modern Fortran', and this term is increasingly used in the literature. Thus, we see that Fortran's particular advantages as a high-end numerical language, especially where arrays are the main form of data object and/or where complex arithmetic is involved, are still to the fore. It is able to attain the highest achievable optimization, mainly because multi-dimensional arrays are'natural'objects and because its pointers are highly constrained. There is every sign that Modern Fortran will continue to be used to tackle major scientific computing problems in the next decade and beyond and will long remain a living tribute to its early pioneers. This third edition of Modern Fortran Explained expands on the second. The material contained in the four final chapters of the second edition have been merged into the main text, thereby offering, in 20 chapters, a comprehensive and uniform description of Fortran 2018. The additional features now brought by the 2023 standard, which are mostly relatively minor in nature, are described in two final chapters, the first on generic programming and the second on the other features. This structure enables the reader to distinguish clearly between what is old and what is new. This new edition, written by experts in the field, three of whom have actively contributed to Fortran 2023, is thus a complete and authoritative description of Fortran in its latest form, with the intention that it remain the main reference work in the field.},

Its scope includes the essential numerical techniques needed to "do physics" on a computer. Each of these is developed heuristically in the text, with the aid of simple mathematical illustrations.

These problems have been chosen to enrich the standard physics curriculum at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level. The book will also be useful to physicists, engineers, and chemists interested in computer modeling and numerical techniques.

@article{backus1978history,
	abstract = {Before 1954 almost all programming was done in machine language or assembly language. Programmers rightly regarded their work as a complex, creative art that required human inventiveness to produce an efficient program. Much of their effort was devoted to overcoming the difficulties created by the computers of that era: the lack of index registers, the lack of built- in floating point operations, restricted instruction sets (which might have AND but not OR, for example), and primitive input- output arrangements. Given the nature of computers, the services which ``automatic programming'' performed for the programmer were concerned with overcoming the machine's shortcomings. Thus the primary concern of some ``automatic programming'' systems was to allow the use of symbolic addresses and decimal numbers (e.g., the MIDAC Input Translation Program [Brown and Carr 1954]).
But most of the larger ``automatic. Programming'' systems (with the exception of Laning and Zierler's algebraic system [Laning and Zierler 1954] and the A-2 compiler [Remington Rand 1953; Moser 1954]) simply provided a synthetic ``computer'' with an order code different from that of the real machine. This synthetic computer usually had floating point instructions and index registers and had improved input-output commands; it was therefore much easier to program than its real counterpart.},
