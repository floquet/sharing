@article{montenbruck2018reduced,
	abstract = {Precise science orbits for the first 4 years of the Swarm mission have been generated from onboard GPS measurements in a systematic reprocessing using refined models and processing techniques. Key enhancements relate to the introduction of macro-models for a more elaborate non-gravitational force modeling (solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag and lift, earth albedo), as well as carrier phase ambiguity fixing. Validation using satellite laser ranging demonstrates a 30\% improvement in the precision of the reduced dynamic orbits with resulting errors at the 0.5--1 cm level (1D RMS). A notable performance improvement is likewise achieved for the kinematic orbits, which benefit most from the ambiguity fixing and show a 50\% error reduction in terms of SLR residuals while differences with respect to reduced dynamic ephemerides amount to only 1.7 cm (median of daily 3D RMS). Compared to the past kinematic science orbits based on float-ambiguity estimates, the new kinematic position solutions exhibit a factor of reduction of two to three in Allan deviation at time scales of 1000s and higher, and promise an improved recovery of low-degree and -order gravity field coefficients in Swarm gravity field analyses.},

@article{du2019novel,
	abstract = {Transmission link disturbances and device failure cause global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to miss observations, leading to poor accuracy in real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. Previously described solutions for this problem are influenced by the length of the prediction period, or are unable to account for changes in receiver state because they use information from previous epochs to make predictions. We propose an algorithm for predicting double difference (DD) observations of obstructed BeiDou navigation system (BDS) GEO satellites. Our approach adopts the first-degree polynomial function for predicting missing observations. We introduce a Douglas-Peucker algorithm to judge the state of the rover receiver to reduce the impact of predictive biases. Static and kinematic experiments were carried out on BDS observations to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal $<$ 2 cm, vertical $<$ 18 cm). Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50\%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are increased by 47\% and 27\% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing data.},

To accomplish challenging science objectives and demanding navigation tasks, deep-space probes host onboard sensors that provide highly accurate measurements for their localization in an extra-terrestrial environment. We present the configuration of a navigation system, including hardware and software architecture, that enables a precise navigation of a SmallSat in a low-altitude orbit about the Moon. The onboard sensors include a radio tracking system to acquire inter-satellite radiometric data, a LiDAR and a visible-wavelength optical camera that collects measurements associated with the relative distance of the probe with respect to the celestial body's surface. The approach presented in this study is well-suited for conducting a joint analysis of radio tracking, altimetry, and imaging data. This involves real-time filtering to achieve precise absolute navigation of a robotic system.},

@article{mao2024precise,
	abstract = {Spaceborne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has significantly revolutionized the development of autonomous orbit determination techniques for low Earth orbit satellites for decades. Using a state-of-the-art combination of GNSS observations and satellite dynamics, the absolute orbit determination for a single satellite reached a precision of 1 cm. Relative orbit determination (ie, precise baseline determination) for the dual satellites reached a precision of 1 mm. This paper reviews the recent advancements in GNSS products, observation processing, satellite gravitational and non-gravitational force modeling, and precise orbit determination methods. These key aspects have increased the precision of the orbit determination to fulfill the requirements of various scientific objectives. Finally, recommendations are made to further investigate multi-GNSS combinations, satellite high-fidelity geometric models, geometric offset calibration, and comprehensive orbit determination strategies for satellite constellations.},

@article{zhang2024novel,
	abstract = {The kinematic approach [i.e., kinematic precise point positioning (PPP)] has been extensively employed in real-time precise orbit determination (RTPOD) of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Nonetheless, this approach typically suffers from a degraded accuracy and robustness due to its sensitivity to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) ephemeris errors and observation quality/geometry. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model into LEO kinematic RTPOD (KRTPOD) to improve its accuracy and robustness. The historical KRTPOD results are compared with external orbit products to compute orbit errors. Meanwhile, multiple features are generated from the historical KRTPOD processing. We train the BPNN model to discover the nonlinear relationship between these features and orbit errors. Based on the trained model, orbit errors of LEO KRTPOD can be forecast according to the input features and then serve as the orbit compensation to improve LEO orbits in real time. Data throughout 2022 from six LEO satellites are processed to examine the performance of this method. Our findings reveal that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of LEO KRTPOD by up to 39.0%. Benefiting from this method, a promising accuracy of 3.2 cm can be achieved in LEO KRTPOD. We also demonstrate the superior generalization ability of the new method under different scenarios. Moreover, this method can enhance the robustness of LEO KRTPOD by mitigating the contamination caused by large GNSS ephemeris errors and accelerating convergence.},

@article{gong2024precise,
	abstract = {The ZY3-03 satellite exhibits a special yaw-steering state to compensate for the drift angle of onboard space cameras with the time-delay-and-integration charge-coupled devices (TDICCDs). The commonly used zero attitude model, which assumes zero yaw, pitch, and roll angles, is no longer suitable. A targeted yaw-attitude model is proposed to express this special yaw state. It still defaults zero pitch and roll angles, but calculates the drift angle based on the orbit of the satellite first, and then adopts the opposite of the drift angle as the yaw angle. The orbit determination experiments have revealed that the zero-yaw assumption in the zero attitude model would result in periodic orbit errors of up to $\pm$86mm in the normal direction, while the proposed model can describe yaw angle variations accurately with errors of less than $\pm$0.01$\,^{\circ}$ in most epochs, and thus avoid the significant normal orbit errors. The proposed yaw-attitude model contributes to the higher-precision orbit determination of ZY3-03. Furthermore, this yaw attitude model also holds practical value for achieving higher-precision orbit determination of other remote sensing satellites similar to ZY3-03, especially when the measured attitude data are not available.},

Compared with standard Kalman filter clock offset model, the new method can detect and control outliers and clock jumps automatically in real-time. Moreover, the clock model parameters, which contain the clock offset, clock speed and clock shift, are classified to decide the adaptive factors in the new model. Thus, clock jumps with different characteristics can be distinguished more effectively. Meanwhile, the dynamic noise characteristics of clock offset series are used for stochastic modeling. An actual numerical example is presented, which shows that the proposed filter can give a better performance than other commonly used filters.},

@article{huang2018improved,
	abstract = {The satellite clocks used in the BeiDou-2 satellite navigation System (BDS) are Chinese self-developed Rb atomic clocks, and their performances and stabilities are worse than GPS and Galileo satellite clocks. Due to special periodic noises and nonlinear system errors existing in the BDS clock offset series, the GPS ultra-rapid clock model, which uses a simple quadratic polynomial plus one periodic is not suitable for BDS. Therefore, an improved prediction model for BDS satellite clocks is proposed in order to enhance the precision of ultra-rapid predicted clock offsets. First, a basic quadratic polynomial model which is fit for the rubidium (Rb) clock is constructed for BDS. Second, the main cyclic terms are detected and identified by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method according to every satellite clock offset series. The detected results show that most BDS clocks have special cyclic terms which are different from the orbit periods. Therefore, two main cyclic terms are added to absorb the periodic effects. Third, after the quadratic polynomial plus two periodic fitting, some evident nonlinear system errors also exist in the model residual, and the Back Propagation (BP) neural network model is chosen to compensate for these nonlinear system errors. The simulation results show that the performance and precision using the improved model are better than that of China iGMAS ultra-rapid prediction (ISU-P) products and the Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum GFZ BDS ultra-rapid prediction (GBU-P) products. Comparing to ISU-P products, the average improvements using the proposed model in 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h are 23.1%, 21.3%, 20.2%, and 19.8%, respectively. Meanwhile the accuracy improvements of the proposed model are 9.9%, 13.9%, 17.3%, and 21.2% compared to GBU-P products. In addition, the kinematic Precise Point Positioning (PPP) example using 8 Multi-GNSS Experiment MGEX stations shows that the precision based on the proposed clock model has improved about 16%, 14%, and 38% in the North (N), East (E) and Height (H) components.},

The conventions defined within this document provide the basis for the specification of antenna phase center offsets and variations in a multi-GNSS version of the IGS absolute phase center model in the ANTEX (antenna exchange) format. To facilitate the joint analysis of GNSS observations and satellite laser ranging measurements, laser retroreflector array coordinates consistent with the IGS-specific spacecraft frame conventions are provided in addition to representative antenna offset values for all GNSS constellations.},

@article{shi2013precise,
	abstract = {China completed a basic COMPASS navigation network with three Geostationary and three Inclined Geosynchronous satellites in orbit in April 2011. The network has been able to provide preliminary positioning and navigation functions. We first present a quality analysis using 1-week COMPASS measurements collected in Wuhan. Satellite visibility and validity of measurements, carrier-to-noise density ratio and code noise are analyzed. The analysis of multipath combinations shows that the noise level of COMPASS code measurements is higher than that of GPS collected using the same receiver. Second, the results of positioning are presented and analyzed. For the standalone COMPASS solutions, an accuracy of 20 m can be achieved. An accuracy of 3.0 m for the vertical, 1.5 m for the North and about 0.6--0.8 m for the East component is obtained using dual-frequency code only measurements for a short baseline. More importantly, code and phase measurements of the short baseline are processed together to obtain precise relative positioning. Kinematic solutions are then compared with the ground truth. The precision of COMPASS only solutions is better than 2 cm for the North component and 4 cm for the vertical. The standard deviation of the East component is smaller than 1 cm, which is even better than that of the East component of GPS solutions. The accuracy of GPS/COMPASS combination solutions is at least 20 % better than that of GPS alone. Furthermore, the geometry-based residuals of double differenced phase and code measurements are analyzed. The analysis shows that the noise level of un-differenced phase measurements is about 2--4 mm on both B1 and B2 frequencies. For the code measurements, the noise level is less than 0.45 m for B1 CA and about 0.35 m for B2 P code. Many of the COMPASS results presented are very promising and have been obtained for the first time.},

@article{huang2017real,
	abstract = {The frequent maneuvering of BeiDou Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites affects the availability of real-time orbit, and decreases the accuracy and performance of positioning, navigation and time (PNT) services. BeiDou satellite maneuver information cannot be obtained by common users. BeiDou broadcast ephemeris is the only indicator of the health status of satellites, which are broadcast on an hourly basis, easily leading to ineffective observations. Sometimes, identification errors of satellite abnormity also appear in the broadcast ephemeris. This study presents a real-time robust detection method for a satellite orbital maneuver with high frequency and high reliability. By using the broadcast ephemeris and pseudo-range observations, the time discrimination factor and the satellite identification factor were defined and used for the real-time detection of start time and the pseudo-random noise code (PRN) of satellites was used for orbital maneuvers. Data from a Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) was collected and analyzed. The results show that the start time and the PRN of the satellite orbital maneuver could be detected accurately in real time. In addition, abnormal start times and satellite abnormities caused by non-maneuver factors also could be detected using the proposed method. The new method not only improves the utilization of observations for users with the data effective for about 92 min, but also promotes the reliability of real-time PNT services.},

@article{jaggi2016swarm,
	abstract = {The Swarm mission consists of three satellites orbiting the Earth at low orbital altitudes. The onboard GPS receivers, star cameras, and laser retro-reflectors make the Swarm mission an interesting candidate to explore the contribution of Swarm GPS data to the recovery of both the static and time-variable gravity fields. We use 1.5 years of Swarm GPS and attitude data to generate kinematic positions of high quality to perform gravity field determination using the Celestial Mechanics Approach. The generated gravity fields reveal severe systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator. Their size is correlated with the ionospheric density and thus strongly varying over the analyzed time period. Similar to the findings of the GOCE mission, the systematic errors are related to the Swarm GPS carrier phase data and may be reduced by rejecting GPS data affected by large ionospheric changes. Such a measure yields a strong reduction of the systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator in the gravity field recovery. Long wavelength signatures of the gravity field may then be recovered with a similar quality as achieved with GRACE GPS data, which makes the Swarm mission well suited to bridge a potential gap between the current GRACE and the future GRACE Follow-On mission.},

@article{montenbruck2002satellite,
	abstract = {This book is intended to be a ``comprehensive textbook that guides the reader through the theory and practice of satellite orbit prediction and determination.'' This reviewer believes the book does just that. However, it is stated that it is intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, and for professionals on the job. The undergraduate would likely have to struggle with the material presented in the book for two reasons. One is that s/he would not have a sufficient background in all the areas covered, and the other is that a significant amount of material is presented in such a concise form that it does not allow one to pick up the background material from the text. The diligent student, however, could refer to the ample references provided (approximately 320) to fill in the background gaps. The author's focus is on providing material currently being used for orbit prediction and determination. (A good portion of the references are from the 1990s.) There is little, if any, discussion of analytic approaches (such as perturbation techniques) that classically have been applied to such problems. There is an extensive amount of practical information regarding force modeling, measurements and filtering, tracking, reckoning time, and computer algorithms. This information is presented in nine chapters, two appendices, and one CD.

The first chapter, entitled Around the World in a Hundred Minutes, summarizes the broad range and types of orbits encountered and has excellent color photos of some recent satellites. The second chapter, Introductory Astrodynamics, is approximately 30 pages and reviews the basic two-body theory with its implications on tracking and determining orbit characteristics. Chapter 3 devotes about 60 pages to the modeling of forces, including the higher harmonics of the gravitational field, the gravitational effects of the Sun and the Moon, Solar radiation, and atmospheric drag. In addition, some consideration is paid to precision modeling with GPS satellites in mind. Chapter 4 devotes about 40 pages to the various methods of integration for precise orbit prediction. The emphasis is on comparing accuracy and effort of the different techniques. Chapter 5 is a very nice discussion of the various time and reference systems which takes about 30 pages. Tracking and observation models are discussed in Chapter 6. These include radar and laser tracking, range, range rate, and the use of GPS signals. Chapter 7 introduces the linearization procedure to supply the required background for Chapter 8 which is Orbit Determination and Parameter Estimation. These chapters occupy about 60 pages. In this next to last chapter, the least squares and Kalman filtering methods are presented. Finally, Chapter 9 supplies three application examples using real data, including one demonstrating error analysis, real time orbit determination, and orbit determination using a relay satellite.

If that were the complete book, this reviewer would suggest that it would be a good addition to your library. However, there is more. The authors have provided a CD with some C++ codes that support all the problems at the ends of the chapters, the three application problems in Chapter 9, and in addition, have some generic satellite codes to support problems that the reader might want to attack. In this generic library are mathematical and astronomical constants, integration routines for differential equations, least squares estimation and Kalman filtering, a force model which includes a 
 gravitational model, Sun and Moon gravitational effects, appropriate coordinate transformations, calendar-time calculations, and some vector/matrix operations. The codes that support the problems at the end of each chapter help to improve the understanding of the chapter and aid readers who are doing a self study. In addition, the CD has an extensive list of website links which support most of the topics in the book and more.

Satellite Orbits: Models, Methods, and Applications would be a valuable addition to the library of any engineer or scientist interested in the practical aspects of orbit prediction and determination. There are few books currently available that cover this material under a single cover, the most recent being, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications by DA Vallado, (McGraw Hill, 1997), which would be a good complimentary text to Satellite Orbits. The comprehensive reference list along with the CD supplied codes make this book unique in this area.},

Various methods for kinematic and reduced-dynamic precise orbit determination (POD) of Low Earth Orbiters (LEO) were developed based on zero- and double-differencing of GPS carrier-phase measurements with and without ambiguity resolution. In this paper we present the following approaches in LEO precise orbit determination: -- zero-difference kinematic POD, -- zero-difference dynamic POD, -- double-difference kinematic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- double-difference dynamic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- combined GPS/SLR reduced-dynamic POD. All developed POD approaches except the combination of GPS/SLR were tested using real CHAMP data (May 20-30, 2001) and independently validated with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data over the same 11 days. With SLR measurements, additional combinations are possible and in that case one can speak of combined kinematic or combined reduced-dynamic POD. First results of such a combined GPS/SLR POD will be presented, too. This paper shows what LEO orbit accuracy may be achieved with GPS using different strategies including zerodifference and double-difference approaches. Kinematic versus dynamic orbit determination is presently an interesting issue that will also be discussed in this article.},

	abstract = {Fast and precise propagation of satellite orbits is required for mission design, orbit determination and payload data analysis. We present a method to improve the computational performance of numerical propagators and simultaneously maintain the accuracy level required by any particular application. This is achieved by determining the positional accuracy needed and the corresponding acceptable error in acceleration on the basis of the mission requirements, removing those perturbation forces whose effect is negligible compared to the accuracy requirement, implementing an efficient and precise algorithm for the harmonic synthesis of the geopotential gradient (i.e., the gravitational acceleration) and adjusting the tolerance of the numerical propagator to achieve the prescribed accuracy level with minimum cost. In particular, to achieve the optimum balance between accuracy and computational performance, the number of geopotential spherical harmonics to retain is adjusted during the integration on the basis of the accuracy requirement. The contribution of high-order harmonics decays rapidly with altitude, so the minimum expansion degree meeting the target accuracy decreases with height. The optimum degree for each altitude
is determined by making the truncation error of the harmonic synthesis equal to the dmissible
acceleration error. This paper presents a detailed description of the technique and test cases highlighting its accuracy and efficiency},

New LEO gravity missions are (to be) equipped with advanced GPS receivers promising to provide very high quality SST observations thereby opening the possibility for computing cm-level accuracy orbits. The computation of orbits at this accuracy level does not only require high-quality GPS receivers, but also advanced and demanding observation preprocessing and correction algorithms. Moreover, sophisticated parameter estimation schemes need to be adapted and extended to allow the computation of such orbits. Finally, reliable methods need to be employed for assessing the orbit quality and providing feedback to the different processing steps in the orbit computation process.},

@book{swatschina2012dynamic,
	abstract = {The precise positioning of satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) has become a key technology
for advanced space missions. Dedicated satellite missions, such as CHAMP, GRACE and
GOCE, that aim to map the Earth's gravity field and its variation over time with
unprecedented accuracy, initiated the demand for highly precise orbit solutions of LEO
satellites. Furthermore, a wide range of additional science opportunities opens up with the
capability to generate accurate LEO orbits. For all considered satellite missions, the primary
measurement system for navigation is a spaceborne GPS receiver. The goal of this thesis is to
establish and implement methods for Precise Orbit Determination (POD) of LEO satellites
using GPS. Striving for highest precision using yet efficient orbit generation strategies, the
attained orbit solutions are aimed to be competitive with the most advanced solutions of
other institutions.
Dynamic and reduced-dynamic orbit models provide the basic concepts of this work. These
orbit models are subsequently adjusted to the highly accurate GPS measurements. The GPS
measurements are introduced at the zero difference level in the ionosphere free linear
combination. Appropriate procedures for GPS data screening and editing are established to
detect erroneous data and to employ measurements of good quality only. For the dynamic
orbit model a sophisticated force model, especially designed for LEO satellites, has been
developed. In order to overcome the limitations that are induced by the deficiencies of the
purely dynamical model, two different types of empirical parameters are introduced into the
force model. These reduced-dynamic orbit models allow for the generation of much longer
orbital arcs while preserving the spacecraft dynamics to the most possible extent. The two
methods for reduced-dynamic orbit modeling are instantaneous velocity changes (pulses) or
piecewise constant accelerations. For both techniques highly efficient modeling algorithms
are presented. The additional parameters are estimated within the adjustment process. In
order to regulate their impact on the dynamic solution, the empirical parameters are
assigned statistical a priori information. This allows for a perfect synergy of the advanced
knowledge of spacecraft dynamics and the high accuracy of the GPS measurements.
The developed routines have been implemented in a computer program and tested for
CHAMP and GRACE. The applied strategies proved to be highly efficient, robust and flexible.
The attained orbit solutions are validated against solutions of other well-established POD
methods. It is shown, that dynamic POD delivers accuracies at the 1 dm level for orbital
lengths of up to 90 minutes. Furthermore, employing an adequate number of pseudostochastic parameters with optimal weighting, reduced-dynamic orbit determination is a
powerful strategy for LEO POD. Orbital arcs over a whole day can be generated with an
accuracy of up to 4.5 cm RMS. },

@article{he2013experimental,
	abstract = {The regional service of the Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system is now in operation with a constellation including five Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites (GEO), five Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites and four Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. Besides the standard positioning service with positioning accuracy of about 10 m, both precise relative positioning and precise point positioning are already demonstrated. As is well known, precise orbit and clock determination is essential in enhancing precise positioning services. To improve the satellite orbits of the BeiDou regional system, we concentrate on the impact of the tracking geometry and the involvement of MEOs, and on the effect of integer ambiguity resolution as well. About seven weeks of data collected at the BeiDou Experimental Test Service (BETS) network is employed in this experimental study. Several tracking scenarios are defined, various processing schemata are designed and carried out; and then, the estimates are compared and analyzed in detail. The results show that GEO orbits, especially the along-track component, can be significantly improved by extending the tracking network in China along longitude direction, whereas IGSOs gain more improvement if the tracking network extends in latitude. The involvement of MEOs and ambiguity-fixing also make the orbits better.},

@article{KAZEMI2024272,
	abstract = {The rapidly growing number of objects encircling our planet is an increasing concern. Collisions between these objects have already occurred and pose a potential threat in the future, resulting in the creation of countless debris fragments. In particular, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region is densely populated and highly contested. This underscores the critical importance of space surveillance in this area. Moreover, the utilization of Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) is also on the rise. To ensure the safety and functionality of operational satellites, it is paramount to accurately determine and continuously monitor the orbits of space objects, mitigating the risk of collisions. Precise and timely predictions of future trajectories are essential for this purpose. In response to these challenges, this survey paper provides a comprehensive review of various methods proposed in the literature for Orbit Determination (OD). It also identifies research gaps and suggests potential directions for future studies, emphasizing the pressing need for adequate Space Situational Awareness (SSA).},
