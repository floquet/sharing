	abstractnote = {A tag enhances vehicle radar visibility of objects by increasing the effective radar cross-section of the object, allowing detection at longer ranges and providing the vehicle/driver with more time to avoid a collision. The tag may include a receive antenna and a bandpass filter configured to receive a signal from the receive antenna and to allow a portion of the frequency range of the signal from the receive antenna through. The tag may also include an amplifier configured to receive and amplify the signal with the portion of the frequency range from the bandpass filter. The tag may further include a transmit antenna configured to transmit the amplified signal. The receive antenna, the transmit antenna, and the amplifier may be configured such that antenna-to-antenna isolation between the receive antenna and the transmit antenna is greater than a gain of the amplifier.},

	abstractnote = {This contribution presents the boundary integral formulation for numerical computation of time-harmonic radar cross section for 3D targets. Method relies on hybrid edge element BEM/FEM to compute near field edge element coefficients that are associated with near electric and magnetic fields at the boundary of the computational domain. Special boundary integral formulation is presented that computes radar cross section directly from these edge element coefficients. Consequently, there is no need for near-to-far field transformation (NTFFT) which is common step in RCS computations. By the end of the paper it is demonstrated that the formulation yields accurate results for canonical models such as spheres, cubes, cones and pyramids. Method has demonstrated accuracy even in the case of dielectrically coated PEC sphere at interior resonance frequency which is common problem for computational electromagnetic codes. - Graphical abstract: - Highlights: * Hybrid edge element BEM/FEM is used to find edge element coefficients. * New formulation for RCS computation directly from edge element coefficients is presented. * Formulation is tested on canonical cases and on coated dielectric sphere at interior resonance frequency.},

	abstractnote = {Often the Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of a target is incorrectly assumed to be a single number by those unfamiliar with electromagnetic scattering. In actuality, a target's RCS depends on many factors. These factors include radar signal frequency, radar observation angle, as well as target orientation. Another possible parameter (often not considered) is time. The RCS of targets may change over time due to movement, environmental changes, etc. In order to accurately represent the dynamic RCS of a target in a time-stepped analysis, the ability to interface with large RCS datasets efficiently is desired. To this end, a file format and API (written in C++) were developed and are described in this report.},

	abstractnote = {The exact radar cross section (RCS) of a sphere made of perfect electrical conductor (PEC) can be computed from the well - known Mie series, and this has made the metal sphere a very useful object for calibrating radar. However, the scattering behavior for homogeneous dielectric spheres, radially - inhomogeneous layered dielectric spheres, or PEC spheres surrounded by multiple homogeneous layers of dielectric material is much more interesting than that of the simple PEC sphere. For example, a homogeneous dielectric sphere can have an RCS that is considerably larger than that of an identically sized PEC sphere, or a PEC sphere with appropriate dielectric coatings can appear much smaller than the uncoated sphere. Possibly more surprising, a dielectric sphere made of the correct magic material can become totally invisible to a monostatic radar, while exhibiting significant scattering in directions away from the back - scatter direction. Exact formulations, based on expansions of the field using vector spherical harmonics, are derived for the bistatic and monostatic RCS of these more complex spheres.},

The surface integral equation is formulated by the PMCHW method, and it is efficient for modeling bulk material scattering. The hybrid surface-volume integral equation approach is better conditioned for the volume scattering problems. For a special class of problems in which the dielectric coating is electrically thin (one to two grid sizes), the numbers of unknowns needed by the two approaches are of the same order, and the surface-volume integral equation approach converges significantly faster than the pure surface integral equation approach. Several numerical examples are given, and the results showed good agreements with the above statement.},

@book{knott2004radar,
	abstract = {Radar cross section (RCS) is a comparison of two radar signal strengths. One is the strength of the radar beam sweeping over a target, the other is the strength of the reflected echo sensed by the receiver. This book shows how the RCS gauge can be predicted for theoretical objects and how it can be measured for real targets. Predicting RCS is not easy, even for simple objects like spheres or cylinders, but this book explains the two exact forms of theory so well that even a novice will understand enough to make close predictions. Weapons systems developers are keenly interested in reducing the RCS of their platforms. The two most practical ways to reduce RCS are shaping and absorption. This book explains both in great detail, especially in the design, evaluation, and selection of radar absorbers. There is also great detail on the design and employment of indoor and outdoor test ranges for scale models or for full-scale targets (such as aircraft). In essence, this book covers everything you need to know about RCS, from what it is, how to predict and measure, and how to test targets (indoors and out), and how to beat it.},
