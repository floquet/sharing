@article{SINGH20131,
	abstract = {High performance computing has been used in various fields of astrophysical research. But most of it is implemented on massively parallel systems (supercomputers) or graphical processing unit clusters. With the advent of multicore processors in the last decade, many serial software codes have been re-implemented in parallel mode to utilize the full potential of these processors. In this paper, we propose parallel processing recipes for multicore machines for astronomical data processing. The target audience is astronomers who use Python as their preferred scripting language and who may be using PyRAF/IRAF for data processing. Three problems of varied complexity were benchmarked on three different types of multicore processors to demonstrate the benefits, in terms of execution time, of parallelizing data processing tasks. The native multiprocessing module available in Python makes it a relatively trivial task to implement the parallel code. We have also compared the three multiprocessing approaches---Pool/Map, Process/Queue and Parallel Python. Our test codes are freely available and can be downloaded from our website.},

@book{analyticMechanics,
	abstract = {Analytical Mechanics, first published in 1999, provides a detailed introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and prepares the reader thoroughly for further study at graduate level. The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics early on in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations, nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature is the inclusion of many 'e-mail questions', which are intended to facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. Many worked examples are given, and there are 250 homework exercises to help students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics, and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to remind the reader of the basics of mathematics and mechanics, which are necessary for understanding the material presented in subsequent chapters. The coordinate systems and transition matrices used in the book are described. The two-body problem is considered, and the equations of motion in an unperturbed Keplerian orbit are obtained. Planetary equations for perturbed motion are written in the Gauss and Lagrange form. The main orbital perturbing forces and torques are considered. The equations of relative motion of one body in the orbital coordinate system of another body are obtained in the simplest spacecraft formation flight statement, and the equations of a rigid body attitude motion are written for a noninertial reference frame. The main theorems of the Lyapunov stability theory are given. Finally, the chapter describes the construction of Poincare sections and the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents spectrum for the analysis of chaotic motions.},
