@article{mccullough2015accuracy,
	abstract = {The orbit determination process, such as that used for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as GRACE, is highly dependent upon the comparison of measured observables with computed values, derived from mathematical models relating the satellites' numerically integrated state to the observable. Significant errors in the computed state corrupt this comparison and induce errors in the least-squares estimate of the satellites' states, as well as the gravity field. Due to the high accuracy of the intersatellite ranging measurements from GRACE, numerical computations must mitigate errors to maintain a similar level of accuracy. One error source is the presence of roundoff errors in the computed intersatellite range-rate when integrating continuous, smoothly varying accelerations with double-precision arithmetic. These errors occur at approximately 8  pm/s  root mean square and limit the accuracy of numerically integrating background gravity field models to degrees/orders 260 and 410 for satellite pairs flying at altitudes of 500 and 300 km respectively. In addition, the integration of filtered, transient accelerations, which occur on timescales much smaller than the integration step size, induce errors at an approximately 10  nm/s
 in range-rate, becoming a limitation as more advanced intersatellite measurement techniques approach this level of accuracy.},

@article{flores2021method,
	abstract = {Fast and precise propagation of satellite orbits is required for mission design, orbit determination and payload data analysis. We present a method to improve the computational performance of numerical propagators and simultaneously maintain the accuracy level required by any particular application. This is achieved by determining the positional accuracy needed and the corresponding acceptable error in acceleration on the basis of the mission requirements, removing those perturbation forces whose effect is negligible compared to the accuracy requirement, implementing an efficient and precise algorithm for the harmonic synthesis of the geopotential gradient (i.e., the gravitational acceleration) and adjusting the tolerance of the numerical propagator to achieve the prescribed accuracy level with minimum cost. In particular, to achieve the optimum balance between accuracy and computational performance, the number of geopotential spherical harmonics to retain is adjusted during the integration on the basis of the accuracy requirement. The contribution of high-order harmonics decays rapidly with altitude, so the minimum expansion degree meeting the target accuracy decreases with height. The optimum degree for each altitude
is determined by making the truncation error of the harmonic synthesis equal to the dmissible
acceleration error. This paper presents a detailed description of the technique and test cases highlighting its accuracy and efficiency},

@article{roh2016numerical,
	abstract = {We study the post-Newtonian perturbations in the orbit of a near-Earth satellite by integrating them with a high-fidelity orbit
propagation software KASIOP. The perturbations of the orbital elements are evaluated for various cases from a low-Earth orbit to a
geostationary one, and from an equatorial to a polar orbit. In particular, the numerical simulation is applied to the LARES-like satellite
under a realistic orbital configuration. The relativistic perturbations include the Schwarzschild term, the effects of Lense-Thirring precession, and the post-Newtonian term due to the quadrupole moment of the Earth as well as the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric and
gravitomagnetic forces, which are produced by the tidal potential of the solar system bodies, are also modeled. The latter three terms
are usually ignored in most orbit-propagation software. The secular variations of the orbital elements are evaluated from the orbital
positions propagated for a half year. For a medium altitude orbit like that of the LARES mission, the magnitude of the relativistic
perturbations ranges from the order of 107 m/s2 by the Schwarzschild effect to 1015 m/s2 by the relativistic tidal effects. The orbital
integration shows that the secular variations in three orbital elements -- the ascending node, the argument of perigee, and the mean
anomaly at epoch -- are larger than the systematic error as results of the relativistic perturbations. The magnitudes of the secular variation
are investigated in terms of the orbital altitude, inclination, and the size of each perturbation force. The numerical simulation rendered in
this study shows that the secular post-Newtonian perturbations with the magnitude lying beyond the Schwarzschild and the
Lense-Thirring effects need to be taken into account in current and upcoming space geodesy missions.},

@article{zanardi2016numerical,
	abstract = {This paper presents the comparison between the numerical and analytical results of a spacecraft attitude propagation for a spin-stabilized satellite. Some external torques are introduced in the equations of the motion and the comparisons are done considering that these torques are acting together, which are: gravity gradient, aerodynamic, solar radiation, magnetic residual and eddy current. In the numerical approach it is used the quaternion to represent the attitude. This numerical approach can be applied for any kind of satellite. The analytical approach is applied directly for a spin-stabilized satellite and the equations of motion are described in terms of the spin velocity, spin axis right ascension and declination angles. An analytical solution of these equations is presented and valid for one orbit period. Applications are developed considering the Brazilian spin-stabilized satellites SCD1 and SCD2. The comparisons are important to validate some simplifications that are required in the analytical approach. The results show that the average components of the external torque are sufficient to observe the main influence of the considered torques.},

@article{klokovcnik2013use,
	abstract = {Dynamic resonance, arising from commensurate (orbital or rotational) periods
of satellites or planets with each other, has been a strong force in the development of the solar system. The repetition of conditions over the commensurate periods can result in amplified long-term changes in the positions of the bodies involved. Such resonant phenomena driven by the commensurability between the mean motion of certain artificial Earth satellites and the Earth's rotation originally contributed to the evaluation and assessment of the Stokes parameters (harmonic geopotential coefficients) that specify the Earth's gravitational field. The technique constrains linear combinations of the harmonic coefficients that are of relevant resonant order (lumped coefficients). The attraction of the method eventually dwindled, but the very accurate orbits of CHAMP and GRACE have recently led to more general insights for commensurate orbits applied to satellite geodesy involving the best resolution for all coefficients, not just resonant ones. From the GRACE mission, we learnt how to explain and predict temporary decreases in the resolution and accuracy of derived geopotential parameters, due to passages through low-order commensurabilities, which lead to lowdensity ground-track patterns. For GOCE we suggest how to change a repeat orbit height slightly, to achieve the best feasible recovery of the field parameters derived from on-board gradiometric measurements by direct inversion from the measurements to the harmonic geopotential coefficients, not by the way of lumped coefficients. For orbiters of Mars, we have suggestions which orbits should be avoided. The slow rotation of Venus results in dense ground-tracks and excellent gravitational recovery for almost all orbiters.},

@book{moulton1970introduction,
	abstract = {An unrivaled text in the field of celestial mechanics, Moulton's theoretical work on the prediction and interpretation of celestial phenomena has not been superseded. By providing a general account of all parts of celestial mechanics without an over-full treatment of any single aspect, by stating all the problems in advance, and, where the transformations are long, giving an outline of the steps which must be made, and by noting all the places where assumptions have been introduced or unjustified methods employed, Moulton has insured that his work will be valuable to all who are interested in the subject.
The text is divided into ten chapters which progress logically in terms of the difficulty of their subject matter. They are: Fundamental Principles and Definitions, Rectilinear Motion, Central Forces, The Potential and Attractions of Bodies, The Problem of Two Bodies, The Determination of Orbits, The General Integrals of the Problem of n Bodies, The Problem of Three Bodies, Perturbations ― Geometrical Considerations, and Perturbations ― Analytical Method. Important topics cove red include general equations, motion of falling particles, the heat of the sun, simultaneous differential equations, examples where J is a function of the coordinates alone, the universality of Newton's law, determination of the orbit from the law of force, attractions of simple solids, potential and attractions of simple bodies and ellipsoids, Ivory's method and level surfaces, elements of orbits, expansions and positions in orbits, transformations of coordinates, the Laplacian and Gaussian methods of determining orbits, motion of center of mass and area integrals, motion of the infinitesimal body, surfaces of zero relative velocity, effects of the components of the disturbing force, lunar theory, method of computing perturbations, and the perturbative function.
Each chapter is followed by a historical sketch and bibliography pertaining to that subject. Over 200 problems appear at key points in the text, many of them answered.},

	abstract = {High performance computing has been used in various fields of astrophysical research. But most of it is implemented on massively parallel systems (supercomputers) or graphical processing unit clusters. With the advent of multicore processors in the last decade, many serial software codes have been re-implemented in parallel mode to utilize the full potential of these processors. In this paper, we propose parallel processing recipes for multicore machines for astronomical data processing. The target audience is astronomers who use Python as their preferred scripting language and who may be using PyRAF/IRAF for data processing. Three problems of varied complexity were benchmarked on three different types of multicore processors to demonstrate the benefits, in terms of execution time, of parallelizing data processing tasks. The native multiprocessing module available in Python makes it a relatively trivial task to implement the parallel code. We have also compared the three multiprocessing approaches---Pool/Map, Process/Queue and Parallel Python. Our test codes are freely available and can be downloaded from our website.},

@book{analyticMechanics,
	abstract = {Analytical Mechanics, first published in 1999, provides a detailed introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and prepares the reader thoroughly for further study at graduate level. The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics early on in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations, nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature is the inclusion of many 'e-mail questions', which are intended to facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. Many worked examples are given, and there are 250 homework exercises to help students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics, and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to remind the reader of the basics of mathematics and mechanics, which are necessary for understanding the material presented in subsequent chapters. The coordinate systems and transition matrices used in the book are described. The two-body problem is considered, and the equations of motion in an unperturbed Keplerian orbit are obtained. Planetary equations for perturbed motion are written in the Gauss and Lagrange form. The main orbital perturbing forces and torques are considered. The equations of relative motion of one body in the orbital coordinate system of another body are obtained in the simplest spacecraft formation flight statement, and the equations of a rigid body attitude motion are written for a noninertial reference frame. The main theorems of the Lyapunov stability theory are given. Finally, the chapter describes the construction of Poincare sections and the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents spectrum for the analysis of chaotic motions.},
