	abstract = {The frequent maneuvering of BeiDou Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites affects the availability of real-time orbit, and decreases the accuracy and performance of positioning, navigation and time (PNT) services. BeiDou satellite maneuver information cannot be obtained by common users. BeiDou broadcast ephemeris is the only indicator of the health status of satellites, which are broadcast on an hourly basis, easily leading to ineffective observations. Sometimes, identification errors of satellite abnormity also appear in the broadcast ephemeris. This study presents a real-time robust detection method for a satellite orbital maneuver with high frequency and high reliability. By using the broadcast ephemeris and pseudo-range observations, the time discrimination factor and the satellite identification factor were defined and used for the real-time detection of start time and the pseudo-random noise code (PRN) of satellites was used for orbital maneuvers. Data from a Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) was collected and analyzed. The results show that the start time and the PRN of the satellite orbital maneuver could be detected accurately in real time. In addition, abnormal start times and satellite abnormities caused by non-maneuver factors also could be detected using the proposed method. The new method not only improves the utilization of observations for users with the data effective for about 92 min, but also promotes the reliability of real-time PNT services.},

@article{he2013experimental,
	abstract = {The regional service of the Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system is now in operation with a constellation including five Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites (GEO), five Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites and four Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. Besides the standard positioning service with positioning accuracy of about 10 m, both precise relative positioning and precise point positioning are already demonstrated. As is well known, precise orbit and clock determination is essential in enhancing precise positioning services. To improve the satellite orbits of the BeiDou regional system, we concentrate on the impact of the tracking geometry and the involvement of MEOs, and on the effect of integer ambiguity resolution as well. About seven weeks of data collected at the BeiDou Experimental Test Service (BETS) network is employed in this experimental study. Several tracking scenarios are defined, various processing schemata are designed and carried out; and then, the estimates are compared and analyzed in detail. The results show that GEO orbits, especially the along-track component, can be significantly improved by extending the tracking network in China along longitude direction, whereas IGSOs gain more improvement if the tracking network extends in latitude. The involvement of MEOs and ambiguity-fixing also make the orbits better.},

@article{du2019novel,
	abstract = {Transmission link disturbances and device failure cause global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to miss observations, leading to poor accuracy in real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. Previously described solutions for this problem are influenced by the length of the prediction period, or are unable to account for changes in receiver state because they use information from previous epochs to make predictions. We propose an algorithm for predicting double difference (DD) observations of obstructed BeiDou navigation system (BDS) GEO satellites. Our approach adopts the first-degree polynomial function for predicting missing observations. We introduce a Douglas-Peucker algorithm to judge the state of the rover receiver to reduce the impact of predictive biases. Static and kinematic experiments were carried out on BDS observations to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal < 2 cm, vertical < 18 cm). Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are increased by 47% and 27% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing data.},

@article{jaggi2016swarm,
	abstract = {The Swarm mission consists of three satellites orbiting the Earth at low orbital altitudes. The onboard GPS receivers, star cameras, and laser retro-reflectors make the Swarm mission an interesting candidate to explore the contribution of Swarm GPS data to the recovery of both the static and time-variable gravity fields. We use 1.5 years of Swarm GPS and attitude data to generate kinematic positions of high quality to perform gravity field determination using the Celestial Mechanics Approach. The generated gravity fields reveal severe systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator. Their size is correlated with the ionospheric density and thus strongly varying over the analyzed time period. Similar to the findings of the GOCE mission, the systematic errors are related to the Swarm GPS carrier phase data and may be reduced by rejecting GPS data affected by large ionospheric changes. Such a measure yields a strong reduction of the systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator in the gravity field recovery. Long wavelength signatures of the gravity field may then be recovered with a similar quality as achieved with GRACE GPS data, which makes the Swarm mission well suited to bridge a potential gap between the current GRACE and the future GRACE Follow-On mission.},

@article{montenbruck2018reduced,
	abstract = {Precise science orbits for the first 4 years of the Swarm mission have been generated from onboard GPS measurements in a systematic reprocessing using refined models and processing techniques. Key enhancements relate to the introduction of macro-models for a more elaborate non-gravitational force modeling (solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag and lift, earth albedo), as well as carrier phase ambiguity fixing. Validation using satellite laser ranging demonstrates a 30% improvement in the precision of the reduced dynamic orbits with resulting errors at the 0.5--1 cm level (1D RMS). A notable performance improvement is likewise achieved for the kinematic orbits, which benefit most from the ambiguity fixing and show a 50% error reduction in terms of SLR residuals while differences with respect to reduced dynamic ephemerides amount to only 1.7 cm (median of daily 3D RMS). Compared to the past kinematic science orbits based on float-ambiguity estimates, the new kinematic position solutions exhibit a factor of reduction of two to three in Allan deviation at time scales of 1000s and higher, and promise an improved recovery of low-degree and -order gravity field coefficients in Swarm gravity field analyses.},

@book{swatschina2012dynamic,
	abstract = {The precise positioning of satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) has become a key technology
for advanced space missions. Dedicated satellite missions, such as CHAMP, GRACE and
GOCE, that aim to map the Earth's gravity field and its variation over time with
unprecedented accuracy, initiated the demand for highly precise orbit solutions of LEO
satellites. Furthermore, a wide range of additional science opportunities opens up with the
capability to generate accurate LEO orbits. For all considered satellite missions, the primary
measurement system for navigation is a spaceborne GPS receiver. The goal of this thesis is to
establish and implement methods for Precise Orbit Determination (POD) of LEO satellites
using GPS. Striving for highest precision using yet efficient orbit generation strategies, the
attained orbit solutions are aimed to be competitive with the most advanced solutions of
other institutions.
Dynamic and reduced-dynamic orbit models provide the basic concepts of this work. These
orbit models are subsequently adjusted to the highly accurate GPS measurements. The GPS
measurements are introduced at the zero difference level in the ionosphere free linear
combination. Appropriate procedures for GPS data screening and editing are established to
detect erroneous data and to employ measurements of good quality only. For the dynamic
orbit model a sophisticated force model, especially designed for LEO satellites, has been
developed. In order to overcome the limitations that are induced by the deficiencies of the
purely dynamical model, two different types of empirical parameters are introduced into the
force model. These reduced-dynamic orbit models allow for the generation of much longer
orbital arcs while preserving the spacecraft dynamics to the most possible extent. The two
methods for reduced-dynamic orbit modeling are instantaneous velocity changes (pulses) or
piecewise constant accelerations. For both techniques highly efficient modeling algorithms
are presented. The additional parameters are estimated within the adjustment process. In
order to regulate their impact on the dynamic solution, the empirical parameters are
assigned statistical a priori information. This allows for a perfect synergy of the advanced
knowledge of spacecraft dynamics and the high accuracy of the GPS measurements.
The developed routines have been implemented in a computer program and tested for
CHAMP and GRACE. The applied strategies proved to be highly efficient, robust and flexible.
The attained orbit solutions are validated against solutions of other well-established POD
methods. It is shown, that dynamic POD delivers accuracies at the 1 dm level for orbital
lengths of up to 90 minutes. Furthermore, employing an adequate number of pseudostochastic parameters with optimal weighting, reduced-dynamic orbit determination is a
powerful strategy for LEO POD. Orbital arcs over a whole day can be generated with an
accuracy of up to 4.5 cm RMS. },

An important result about full quaternions is that they can be partitioned into a unit quaternion (which describes the orientation with respect to a suitable reference), and a modulus (which represents the translational motion along the direction indicated by the unit quaternion). Since vectors and scalars are also fullquaternions, the equations of body motion can be rewritten in quaternion form. In this paper the orbit dynamics and kinematics of a point mass moving in the space are transformed in quaternion form. Simple application examples are presented.},

@article{visser2003aiming,
	abstract = {The computation of high-accuracy orbits is a prerequisite for the success of Low Earth Orbiter (LEO) missions such as CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE. The mission objectives of these satellites cannot be reached without computing orbits with an accuracy at the few cm level. Such a level of accuracy might be achieved with the techniques of reduced-dynamic and kinematic precise orbit determination (POD) assuming continuous Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Both techniques have reached a high level of maturity and have been successfully applied to missions in the past, for example to TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P), leading to (sub-)decimeter orbit accuracy. New LEO gravity missions are (to be) equipped with advanced GPS receivers promising to provide very high quality SST observations thereby opening the possibility for computing cm-level accuracy orbits. The computation of orbits at this accuracy level does not only require high-quality GPS receivers, but also advanced and demanding observation preprocessing and correction algorithms. Moreover, sophisticated parameter estimation schemes need to be adapted and extended to allow the computation of such orbits. Finally, reliable methods need to be employed for assessing the orbit quality and providing feedback to the different processing steps in the orbit computation process.},

@article{vsvehla2003kinematic,
	abstract = {Abstract. Various methods for kinematic and reduced-dynamic precise orbit determination (POD) of Low Earth Orbiters (LEO) were developed based on zero- and double-differencing of GPS carrier-phase measurements with and without ambiguity resolution. In this paper we present the following approaches in LEO precise orbit determination: -- zero-difference kinematic POD, -- zero-difference dynamic POD, -- double-difference kinematic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- double-difference dynamic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- combined GPS/SLR reduced-dynamic POD. All developed POD approaches except the combination of GPS/SLR were tested using real CHAMP data (May 20-30, 2001) and independently validated with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data over the same 11 days. With SLR measurements, additional combinations are possible and in that case one can speak of combined kinematic or combined reduced-dynamic POD. First results of such a combined GPS/SLR POD will be presented, too. This paper shows what LEO orbit accuracy may be achieved with GPS using different strategies including zerodifference and double-difference approaches. Kinematic versus dynamic orbit determination is presently an interesting issue that will also be discussed in this article.},

@article{montenbruck2002satellite,
	abstract = {This book is intended to be a ``comprehensive textbook that guides the reader through the theory and practice of satellite orbit prediction and determination.'' This reviewer believes the book does just that. However, it is stated that it is intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, and for professionals on the job. The undergraduate would likely have to struggle with the material presented in the book for two reasons. One is that s/he would not have a sufficient background in all the areas covered, and the other is that a significant amount of material is presented in such a concise form that it does not allow one to pick up the background material from the text. The diligent student, however, could refer to the ample references provided (approximately 320) to fill in the background gaps. The author's focus is on providing material currently being used for orbit prediction and determination. (A good portion of the references are from the 1990s.) There is little, if any, discussion of analytic approaches (such as perturbation techniques) that classically have been applied to such problems. There is an extensive amount of practical information regarding force modeling, measurements and filtering, tracking, reckoning time, and computer algorithms. This information is presented in nine chapters, two appendices, and one CD.

The first chapter, entitled Around the World in a Hundred Minutes, summarizes the broad range and types of orbits encountered and has excellent color photos of some recent satellites. The second chapter, Introductory Astrodynamics, is approximately 30 pages and reviews the basic two-body theory with its implications on tracking and determining orbit characteristics. Chapter 3 devotes about 60 pages to the modeling of forces, including the higher harmonics of the gravitational field, the gravitational effects of the Sun and the Moon, Solar radiation, and atmospheric drag. In addition, some consideration is paid to precision modeling with GPS satellites in mind. Chapter 4 devotes about 40 pages to the various methods of integration for precise orbit prediction. The emphasis is on comparing accuracy and effort of the different techniques. Chapter 5 is a very nice discussion of the various time and reference systems which takes about 30 pages. Tracking and observation models are discussed in Chapter 6. These include radar and laser tracking, range, range rate, and the use of GPS signals. Chapter 7 introduces the linearization procedure to supply the required background for Chapter 8 which is Orbit Determination and Parameter Estimation. These chapters occupy about 60 pages. In this next to last chapter, the least squares and Kalman filtering methods are presented. Finally, Chapter 9 supplies three application examples using real data, including one demonstrating error analysis, real time orbit determination, and orbit determination using a relay satellite.

If that were the complete book, this reviewer would suggest that it would be a good addition to your library. However, there is more. The authors have provided a CD with some C++ codes that support all the problems at the ends of the chapters, the three application problems in Chapter 9, and in addition, have some generic satellite codes to support problems that the reader might want to attack. In this generic library are mathematical and astronomical constants, integration routines for differential equations, least squares estimation and Kalman filtering, a force model which includes a 
 gravitational model, Sun and Moon gravitational effects, appropriate coordinate transformations, calendar-time calculations, and some vector/matrix operations. The codes that support the problems at the end of each chapter help to improve the understanding of the chapter and aid readers who are doing a self study. In addition, the CD has an extensive list of website links which support most of the topics in the book and more.

Satellite Orbits: Models, Methods, and Applications would be a valuable addition to the library of any engineer or scientist interested in the practical aspects of orbit prediction and determination. There are few books currently available that cover this material under a single cover, the most recent being, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications by DA Vallado, (McGraw Hill, 1997), which would be a good complimentary text to Satellite Orbits. The comprehensive reference list along with the CD supplied codes make this book unique in this area.},

The STK simulations showed that a relatively low eccentricity can be achieved with a sun-pointing perigee strategy but that fuel utilization was fairly the same in all of the scenarios.

A strong understanding of the orbital domain and orbital dynamics is necessary to effectively evade these attackers. Much like the early days of aviation, space innovation has outpaced existing tactics, techniques and procedures. This thesis aims to provide an overview of the domain and possible evasive maneuvers to facilitate further tactics development. It begins with an overview of the threat landscape to provide background on what to expect and proceeds to discuss what positions of advantage are in space and how thrust commands translate to maneuvers at different time scales. It details the development of an engagement simulator and provides insight as to the effect of various evasion thrust patterns. From this, an evasion tactic is developed and tested in the simulator. This tactic proves effective in evading an aggressor while also demonstrating substantial fuel savings over alternative methods. Finally, different spacecraft parameters are compared to determine what hardware improvements provide the best evasive capability. },

It also presents a unique opportunity to make use of a growing supply of in-space resources for the benefit of the satellite community. ``The Recycler'' is a mission proposed to source replacements for failed components in GEO satellites by extracting functioning components from non-operational spacecraft in the GEO graveyard. This paper demonstrates a method of analyzing in-space re-purposing missions such as the Recycler, using real satellite data to provide a strong platform for accurate performance estimates. An inventory of 1107 satellites in the extended GEO region is presented, and a review into past GEO satellite anomalies is conducted to show that solar arrays would be in the greatest demand for re-purposing. This inventory is used as an input to a greedy selection algorithm and trajectory simulation to show that the Recycler spacecraft could harvest components for 67 client satellites with its allotted fuel budget. This capacity directly meets the levels of customer demand estimated from the GEO satellite anomaly data, placing the Recycler as a strong contender in a future second-hand satellite-component industry. Propellant mass is found to be a greater restriction on the Recycler mission than its 15-year lifetime --- a problem which could be solved by on-orbit refueling.},

	abstract = {In nominal mission scenarios, geostationary satellites perform end-of-life orbit maneuvers to reach suitable disposal orbits, where they do not interfere with operational satellites. This research investigates the long-term orbit evolution of decommissioned geostationary satellite under the assumption that the disposal maneuver does not occur and the orbit evolves with no control. The dynamical model accounts for all the relevant harmonics of the terrestrial gravity field at the typical altitude of geostationary orbits, as well as solar radiation pressure and third-body perturbations caused by the Moon and the Sun. Orbit propagations are performed using two algorithms based on different equations of motion and numerical integration methods:(i) Gauss planetary equations for modified equinoctial elements with a Runge-Kutta numerical integration scheme based on 8--7th-order Dorman and Prince formulas;(ii) Cartesian state equations of motion in an Earth-fixed frame with a Runge-Kutta Fehlberg 7/8 integration scheme. The numerical results exhibit excellent agreement over integration times of decades. Some well-known phenomena emerge, such as the longitudinal drift due to the resonance between the orbital motion and Earth's rotation, attributable to the J 22 term of the geopotential. In addition, the third-body perturbation due to Sun and Moon causes two major effects:(a) a precession of the orbital plane, and (b) complex longitudinal dynamics. This study proposes an analytical approach for the prediction of the precessional motion and show its agreement with the (more accurate) orbit evolution obtained numerically.

knowledge of the worst case environment and the number of arcs
to be endured during the spacecraft lifetime. In this paper, we
define the criteria to be used to specify the worst case geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) charging environment (plasma density
and temperature), including the physical constraints on particle
and magnetic field energy densities and the relative importance of
frame charging and differential charging. A previous estimate of
the frequency of arcing (found in the literature and incorporated
into an International Standards Organization standard) and the
consequent total number of arcs to be encountered in a GEO
satellite lifetime are found to be incorrect because they were
based on environmental measurements using a faulty algorithm
to determine spacecraft charging and plasma density. Using more
accurate estimates of the frequency of GEO plasma densities
and temperatures, we arrive at a much lower estimate of the
total number of arcs during a GEO satellite lifetime. Finally, the
worst case GEO charging environment seen to date is determined
from Nascap-2k simulations. Our estimates of worst case charging
environments and arc frequencies may be more confidently used
by GEO spacecraft designers and test engineers.},

@inproceedings{chen2016determination,
	abstract = {This study aims to statistically estimate the errors in local magnetic field directions that are derived from electron directional distributions measured by Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous (LANL GEO) satellites. First, by comparing derived and measured magnetic field directions along the GEO orbit to those calculated from three selected empirical global magnetic field models (including a static Olson and Pfitzer 1977 quiet magnetic field model, a simple dynamic Tsyganenko 1989 model, and a sophisticated dynamic Tsyganenko 2001 storm model), it is shown that the errors in both derived and modeled directions are at least comparable. Second, using a newly developed proxy method as well as comparing results from empirical models, we are able to provide for the first time circumstantial evidence showing that derived magnetic field directions should statistically match the real magnetic directions better, with averaged errors< ~2$\,^{\circ}$, than those from the three empirical models with averaged errors >~5$\,^{\circ}$. In addition, our results suggest that the errors in derived magnetic field directions do not depend much on magnetospheric activity, in contrast to the empirical field models. Finally, as applications of the above conclusions, we show examples of electron pitch angle distributions observed by LANL GEO and also take the derived magnetic field directions as the real ones so as to test the performance of empirical field models along the GEO orbits, with results suggesting dependence on solar cycles as well as satellite locations. This study demonstrates the validity and value of the method that infers local magnetic field directions from particle spin-resolved distributions.},

On the period of study, the MHD code was able to capture a dipolarization event and the particle tracing algorithm was able to capture our results of these disturbances and calculate proton fluxes in the night side geosynchronous orbit region. The simulation captured dispersionless injections as well as the energy dispersion signatures that are frequently observed by satellites at geosynchronous orbit. Currently, ring current models rely on Maxwellian-type distributions based on either empirical flux values or sparse satellite data for their boundary conditions close to geosynchronous orbit.

@article{bhaskar2021radiation,
	abstract = {Fast reverse shocks (FRSs) cause the magnetosphere to expand, by contrast to the well-known compressions caused by the impact of fast forward shocks (FFS). Usually, FFSs are more geoeffective than FRSs, and consequently the inner magnetosphere dynamic responses to both shock types can be quite different. In this study, we investigate for the first time the radiation belt response to an FRS impact using multi-satellite observations and numerical simulations. Spacecraft on the dayside observed decreases in magnetic field strength and energetic (∼ 40--475 keV) particle fluxes. Timing analysis shows that the magnetic field signature propagated from the dayside to the nightside magnetosphere. Particles with different energies vary simultaneously at each spacecraft, implying a non-dispersive particle response to the shock. Spacecraft located at lower L-shells did not record any significant signatures. The observations indicate a local time dependence of the response associated with the shock inclination, with the clearest signatures being observed in the dusk--midnight sector. Simulations underestimate the amplitude of the magnetic field variations observed on the nightside. The observed decreases in the electron intensities result from a combination of radial gradient and adiabatic effects. The radial gradients in the spectral index appear to be the dominant contributor to the observed variations of electrons seen on the dayside (near noon and dusk) and on the nightside (near midnight). This study shows that even an FRS can affect the radiation belts significantly and provides an opportunity to understand their dynamic response to a sudden expansion of the magnetosphere.},

From an aerodynamic perspective, efforts have been devoted to the study ofaminimum-dragbody, abodywithminimumsurfaceheattransfer rate, and an aerodynamic design of a high-speed propulsion nozzle. In early research, most of the studies implemented analytical or experimental approaches. In the 1980s and 1990s, the numerical approach was the major aerodynamic design tool with the advancement of computational uid dynamics. Minimum-drag bodies have been studied extensively since the 1950s. Zandbergen1 and Parker2 derived supersonic minimum-drag bodies using the method of characteristics and the linearized supersonic theory. In the hypersonic regime, Eggers et al. 3 derived a minimum-drag body with a small nose radius using Newtonian impact theory and showed that a power-law body (R» xn) approximated the minimum-drag body when the power-law exponentn was 0.75. Mason and Lee4 performed a numerical study to fi nd an exponent of the minimum-drag power-law body using Euler equations. Zoby and Thompson5 studied the effects of the nose radius and the angle of attack on a surface heat transfer and drag characteristicsin hypersonic ow using a viscous shock-layer computer code. Even though the drag and the surface heat transfer both are important in the design of space launch vehicles, studies on the minimumdrag body and the minimum surface heat transfer rate have been performed independently. There have been studies on the stagnation point heating, drag, and nose bluntness about power law shapes, 6 but less effort has been devoted to the design studies, which consider both drag and heat transfer characteristics together. In the present study, the representative shapes have been chosen from the nose fairing shapes of existing space launch vehicles, and the drag and the heat transfer characteristics have been investigated in the hypersonic ow regime of freestream Mach number M1 D 5» 8. The minimum-drag body with a given surface heat ux constraint is designed with two well-known aerodynamic design methods, the inverse design and the numerical shape optimization. The inverse design is performed in conjunction with a parabolized Navier--Stokes (PNS) solver. In the numerical optimization, the modifi ed Newtonian theory is applied, and internal volume is considered as a design constraint, in addition to surface heat ux, because payloads areaccommodatedinnosefairings.

Analysis on infrared video footage (obtained from the tracking stations) during the descent estimated the onset of the capsule tumble at Mach 0.9. Frequency analysis on the infrared video data indicates that the aerodynamics generated for the Genesis capsule reasonably predicted the drag and static stability. Observations of the heatshield support the preentry simulation estimates of small hypersonic angles of attack, because there is very little, if any, charring of the shoulder region or the aftbody. Through this investigation, an overall assertion can be made that all the data gathered from the Genesis entry is consistent with flight performance that was close to the nominal preentry prediction. Consequently, the design principles and methodologies used for the flight dynamics, aerodynamics, and aerothermodynamics analyses have been corroborated.},

Mass reduction is achieved by using a strong but lightweight inflatable structure and by eliminating the need for a backshell. Performance analysis has shown that additional mass savings is achievable using entry guidance technologies that reduce powered descent propellant mass by directly controlling angle of attack and sideslip, rather than the traditional bank angle control approach used by the current state-of-the-art Mars Science Laboratory entry vehicle.

To that end, the Safe and Precise Landing Integrated Capabilities Evolution (SPLICE) project has demonstrated that a detailed six degree-of-freedom integrated performance simulation framework can provide information on and assessment of expected navigation performance. This framework incorporates engineering models of the on-board spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control systems at varying levels of fidelity. Recent advances in the development of this integrated performance simulation permit running these systems ``in-the-loop,'' rather than assuming perfect knowledge of the spacecraft states. This development, coupled with fast simulation time and modularization of the various system models, enables a wide variety of system trades to be assessed at once. This paper presents a summary of the advances in the SPLICE simulation framework, updates to the spacecraft navigation models, and an application of the framework to characterize the precision landing performance of a human-scale lunar lander.

further downrange than the predicted landing location. Analysis of the flight data revealed
that the primary cause of Phoenix's downrange landing was a higher trim total angle of attack during the hypersonic phase of the entry, which resulted in Phoenix flying a slightly lifting trajectory. The cause of this higher trim attitude is not known at this time. Parachute
deployment was 6.4 s later than prediction. This later deployment time was within the variations expected and is consistent with a lifting trajectory. The parachute deployment and inflation process occurred as expected with no anomalies identified. The subsequent parachute
descent and powered terminal landing also behaved as expected. A preliminary reconstruction of the landing day atmospheric density profile was found to be lower than the best apriori prediction, ranging from a few percent less to a maximum of 8%. A comparison of the
flight reconstructed trajectory parameters shows that the actual Phoenix entry, descent, and

@article{hanspeter2003analytical,
	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of dynamics of space systems, starting with the fundamentals and covering topics from basic kinematics and dynamics to more advanced celestial mechanics. All material is presented in a consistent manner, and the reader is guided through the various derivations and proofs in a tutorial way. Cookbook formulas are avoided; instead, the reader is led to understand the principles underlying the equations at issue, and shown how to apply them to various dynamical systems. The book is divided into two parts. Part I covers analytical treatment of topics such as basic dynamic principles up to advanced energy concepts. Special attention is paid to the use of rotating reference frames that often occur in aerospace systems. Part II covers basic celestial mechanics, treating the two-body problem, restricted three-body problem, gravity field modeling, perturbation methods, spacecraft formation flying, and orbit transfers. MATLAB{\textregistered}, Mathematica{\textregistered} and C-Code toolboxes are provided for the rigid body kinematics routines discussed in chapter 3, and the basic orbital 2-body orbital mechanics routines discussed in chapter 9. A solutions manual is also available for professors.

	abstract = {The orbit determination process, such as that used for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as GRACE, is highly dependent upon the comparison of measured observables with computed values, derived from mathematical models relating the satellites' numerically integrated state to the observable. Significant errors in the computed state corrupt this comparison and induce errors in the least-squares estimate of the satellites' states, as well as the gravity field. Due to the high accuracy of the intersatellite ranging measurements from GRACE, numerical computations must mitigate errors to maintain a similar level of accuracy. One error source is the presence of roundoff errors in the computed intersatellite range-rate when integrating continuous, smoothly varying accelerations with double-precision arithmetic. These errors occur at approximately 8  pm/s  root mean square and limit the accuracy of numerically integrating background gravity field models to degrees/orders 260 and 410 for satellite pairs flying at altitudes of 500 and 300 km respectively. In addition, the integration of filtered, transient accelerations, which occur on timescales much smaller than the integration step size, induce errors at an approximately 10  nm/s
 in range-rate, becoming a limitation as more advanced intersatellite measurement techniques approach this level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Fast and precise propagation of satellite orbits is required for mission design, orbit determination and payload data analysis. We present a method to improve the computational performance of numerical propagators and simultaneously maintain the accuracy level required by any particular application. This is achieved by determining the positional accuracy needed and the corresponding acceptable error in acceleration on the basis of the mission requirements, removing those perturbation forces whose effect is negligible compared to the accuracy requirement, implementing an efficient and precise algorithm for the harmonic synthesis of the geopotential gradient (i.e., the gravitational acceleration) and adjusting the tolerance of the numerical propagator to achieve the prescribed accuracy level with minimum cost. In particular, to achieve the optimum balance between accuracy and computational performance, the number of geopotential spherical harmonics to retain is adjusted during the integration on the basis of the accuracy requirement. The contribution of high-order harmonics decays rapidly with altitude, so the minimum expansion degree meeting the target accuracy decreases with height. The optimum degree for each altitude
is determined by making the truncation error of the harmonic synthesis equal to the dmissible
acceleration error. This paper presents a detailed description of the technique and test cases highlighting its accuracy and efficiency},

propagation software KASIOP. The perturbations of the orbital elements are evaluated for various cases from a low-Earth orbit to a
geostationary one, and from an equatorial to a polar orbit. In particular, the numerical simulation is applied to the LARES-like satellite
under a realistic orbital configuration. The relativistic perturbations include the Schwarzschild term, the effects of Lense-Thirring precession, and the post-Newtonian term due to the quadrupole moment of the Earth as well as the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric and
gravitomagnetic forces, which are produced by the tidal potential of the solar system bodies, are also modeled. The latter three terms
are usually ignored in most orbit-propagation software. The secular variations of the orbital elements are evaluated from the orbital
positions propagated for a half year. For a medium altitude orbit like that of the LARES mission, the magnitude of the relativistic
perturbations ranges from the order of 107 m/s2 by the Schwarzschild effect to 1015 m/s2 by the relativistic tidal effects. The orbital
integration shows that the secular variations in three orbital elements -- the ascending node, the argument of perigee, and the mean
anomaly at epoch -- are larger than the systematic error as results of the relativistic perturbations. The magnitudes of the secular variation
are investigated in terms of the orbital altitude, inclination, and the size of each perturbation force. The numerical simulation rendered in
this study shows that the secular post-Newtonian perturbations with the magnitude lying beyond the Schwarzschild and the
Lense-Thirring effects need to be taken into account in current and upcoming space geodesy missions.},

Some external torques are introduced in the equations of the motion and the comparisons are done considering that these torques are acting together, which are: gravity gradient, aerodynamic, solar radiation, magnetic residual and eddy current. In the numerical approach it is used the quaternion to represent the attitude. This numerical approach can be applied for any kind of satellite. The analytical approach is applied directly for a spin-stabilized satellite and the equations of motion are described in terms of the spin velocity, spin axis right ascension and declination angles. An analytical solution of these equations is presented and valid for one orbit period. Applications are developed considering the Brazilian spin-stabilized satellites SCD1 and SCD2. The comparisons are important to validate some simplifications that are required in the analytical approach. The results show that the average components of the external torque are sufficient to observe the main influence of the considered torques.},

	abstract = {Dynamic resonance, arising from commensurate (orbital or rotational) periods
of satellites or planets with each other, has been a strong force in the development of the solar system. The repetition of conditions over the commensurate periods can result in amplified long-term changes in the positions of the bodies involved. Such resonant phenomena driven by the commensurability between the mean motion of certain artificial Earth satellites and the Earth's rotation originally contributed to the evaluation and assessment of the Stokes parameters (harmonic geopotential coefficients) that specify the Earth's gravitational field. The technique constrains linear combinations of the harmonic coefficients that are of relevant resonant order (lumped coefficients). The attraction of the method eventually dwindled, but the very accurate orbits of CHAMP and GRACE have recently led to more general insights for commensurate orbits applied to satellite geodesy involving the best resolution for all coefficients, not just resonant ones. From the GRACE mission, we learnt how to explain and predict temporary decreases in the resolution and accuracy of derived geopotential parameters, due to passages through low-order commensurabilities, which lead to lowdensity ground-track patterns. For GOCE we suggest how to change a repeat orbit height slightly, to achieve the best feasible recovery of the field parameters derived from on-board gradiometric measurements by direct inversion from the measurements to the harmonic geopotential coefficients, not by the way of lumped coefficients. For orbiters of Mars, we have suggestions which orbits should be avoided. The slow rotation of Venus results in dense ground-tracks and excellent gravitational recovery for almost all orbiters.},

By providing a general account of all parts of celestial mechanics without an over-full treatment of any single aspect, by stating all the problems in advance, and, where the transformations are long, giving an outline of the steps which must be made, and by noting all the places where assumptions have been introduced or unjustified methods employed, Moulton has insured that his work will be valuable to all who are interested in the subject.
The text is divided into ten chapters which progress logically in terms of the difficulty of their subject matter. They are: Fundamental Principles and Definitions, Rectilinear Motion, Central Forces, The Potential and Attractions of Bodies, The Problem of Two Bodies, The Determination of Orbits, The General Integrals of the Problem of n Bodies, The Problem of Three Bodies, Perturbations ― Geometrical Considerations, and Perturbations ― Analytical Method. Important topics cove red include general equations, motion of falling particles, the heat of the sun, simultaneous differential equations, examples where J is a function of the coordinates alone, the universality of Newton's law, determination of the orbit from the law of force, attractions of simple solids, potential and attractions of simple bodies and ellipsoids, Ivory's method and level surfaces, elements of orbits, expansions and positions in orbits, transformations of coordinates, the Laplacian and Gaussian methods of determining orbits, motion of center of mass and area integrals, motion of the infinitesimal body, surfaces of zero relative velocity, effects of the components of the disturbing force, lunar theory, method of computing perturbations, and the perturbative function.
Each chapter is followed by a historical sketch and bibliography pertaining to that subject. Over 200 problems appear at key points in the text, many of them answered.},

With the advent of multicore processors in the last decade, many serial software codes have been re-implemented in parallel mode to utilize the full potential of these processors. In this paper, we propose parallel processing recipes for multicore machines for astronomical data processing. The target audience is astronomers who use Python as their preferred scripting language and who may be using PyRAF/IRAF for data processing. Three problems of varied complexity were benchmarked on three different types of multicore processors to demonstrate the benefits, in terms of execution time, of parallelizing data processing tasks. The native multiprocessing module available in Python makes it a relatively trivial task to implement the parallel code. We have also compared the three multiprocessing approaches---Pool/Map, Process/Queue and Parallel Python. Our test codes are freely available and can be downloaded from our website.},

@book{analyticMechanics,
	abstract = {Analytical Mechanics, first published in 1999, provides a detailed introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and prepares the reader thoroughly for further study at graduate level. The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics early on in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations, nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature is the inclusion of many 'e-mail questions', which are intended to facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. Many worked examples are given, and there are 250 homework exercises to help students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics, and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.},

The coordinate systems and transition matrices used in the book are described. The two-body problem is considered, and the equations of motion in an unperturbed Keplerian orbit are obtained. Planetary equations for perturbed motion are written in the Gauss and Lagrange form. The main orbital perturbing forces and torques are considered. The equations of relative motion of one body in the orbital coordinate system of another body are obtained in the simplest spacecraft formation flight statement, and the equations of a rigid body attitude motion are written for a noninertial reference frame. The main theorems of the Lyapunov stability theory are given. Finally, the chapter describes the construction of Poincare sections and the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents spectrum for the analysis of chaotic motions.},
