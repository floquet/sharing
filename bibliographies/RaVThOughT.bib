@article{mandidesign,
	abstract = {The purpose of this study is simulating the station keeping maneuvers of a geostationary (GEO) satellite and applying a suitable control scheme to be able to keep the satellite in desired orbit against the external disturbance forces using an electric propulsion system. In general, the Keplerian elements are used to show the variation of the orbit over time and calculations are done with eccentricity, inclination and longitude vectors. Different from classical station keeping maneuver, relative motion is processed in this study. Through using relative motion, all required adjustments are interpreted with x, y and z with respect to the target point. To create the required control scheme, it is necessary to model the satellite's equation of motion and the motion is described with Clohessy-Hill equations as relative to virtual reference. The next step is calculation of the thrust amount to overcome the perturbation and to decrease the distance between two points.},

@inproceedings{hunter1999counterflow,
	abstract = {
    A computational study of fluidic counterflow thrust vectoring was conducted, utilizing the PAB3D computational fluid dynamics code with two-equation turbulence closure and Reynolds stress modeling. The study validated computational results against experimental data and explored the physics of counterflow-induced thrust vectoring. It was revealed that effective vectoring can be achieved with less than 1\% secondary flow requirements. Insights into shear layer dynamics and pressure gradients were presented, offering implications for improved control in multi-functional propulsion systems.

@article{das2023fluidic,
	abstract = {An efficient propulsion system holds the key to the smooth operation of any aerospace vehicle over different flight regimes. Apart from generating the necessary thrust, emphasis has also been laid on vectoring the direction of thrust. The primitive modes of thrust vectoring chiefly focused on mechanical means such as the use of gimbals or hinges. The current state-of-the-art technologies demand more efficient methods for thrust vectoring, which minimize the use of mechanical components. These methods termed fluidic thrust vector control methods, employ secondary jets for achieving the required attitude, and trajectory of the aerospace vehicles such as aircraft, rockets, and missiles. Such methods have greatly helped in reducing vehicle weight, vehicle maintenance requirements, and enhancement of stealth characteristics of such vehicles. This work presents a review of the various fluidic thrust vectoring systems, starting with a brief overview of traditional thrust vectoring systems, followed by a discussion on the various aspects of fluidic thrust vectoring systems. It also highlights the effect of the various geometrical and operating conditions on the performance parameters of the thrust vectoring system such as the thrust vector angle, system thrust ratio, and thrust vectoring efficiency among others. For ensuring the comprehensive character of this work, synthetic jet vectoring techniques have also been included due to their nonmechanical nature and similarities with purely fluidic thrust vectoring techniques.},

    experimentally documented and analytically compared, with the 
    dual grid system demonstrating the most promise due to its

    the challenges of ion beam deflection, including iterative 
    computational solutions and mechanical design trade-offs, while 
    proposing scalable approaches for future applications.

@inproceedings{moutet2024thrust,
	abstract = {
    This paper presents a prototype of a null deflection double linear axis thrust balance designed
    for 2D measurements of the vectorization of the thrust produced by electrical thrusters. The
    thrust measurement range spans from a few micro-Newtons to 10 milli-Newtons, with an
    accuracy of $\pm$50 micro-Newtons. Key features include scalable design, high repeatability,
    and the capability to validate thrust vectorization. This balance paves the way for a full
    3D thrust stand for comprehensive vectorization measurements.
