	abstract = {
    This report explores thrust vectoring techniques for a 5 cm mercury
    bombardment ion thruster. Key findings include the evaluation of 
    three vectoring systems: dual grid electrostatic, movable screen 
    electrode, and vectorable discharge chamber. Performance was 
    experimentally documented and analytically compared, with the 
    dual grid system demonstrating the most promise due to its 
    responsiveness and lack of moving parts. The report highlights 
    the challenges of ion beam deflection, including iterative 
    computational solutions and mechanical design trade-offs, while 
    proposing scalable approaches for future applications.

@inproceedings{moutet2024thrust,
	abstract = {
    This paper presents a prototype of a null deflection double linear axis thrust balance designed
    for 2D measurements of the vectorization of the thrust produced by electrical thrusters. The
    thrust measurement range spans from a few micro-Newtons to 10 milli-Newtons, with an
    accuracy of $\pm$50 micro-Newtons. Key features include scalable design, high repeatability,
    and the capability to validate thrust vectorization. This balance paves the way for a full
    3D thrust stand for comprehensive vectorization measurements.
