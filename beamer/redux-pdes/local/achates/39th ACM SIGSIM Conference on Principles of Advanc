Evolution of PADS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PADS conference originated as the "Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Simulation," 
focused specifically on parallel and distributed methods for discrete event simulation. 

Over time, the conference evolved into the "Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation," 
retaining the original acronym while expanding its scope to cover broader topics 
in discrete simulation, including advanced synchronization, modeling methodologies, 
and computational frameworks.

Key Evidence Supporting This Evolution:
1. The retention of the acronym "PADS" across historical and modern iterations of the conference.
2. References in ACM SIGSIM materials and conference proceedings highlighting continuity.
3. Historical records and proceedings showcasing a gradual broadening of topics.

This evolution reflects the growth of the simulation field, acknowledging the importance 
of parallel and distributed techniques while accommodating advancements in the broader 
domain of discrete simulation.
