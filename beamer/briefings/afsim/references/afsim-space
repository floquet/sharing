IST are the original developers of AFSIM space capability and the space boxset in the AFSIM framework. IST has vast experience developing new model capabilities, data rich displays, and adaptable interfaces to meet modeling and simulation requirements for space assets as well as other emerging technologies.

 

 

    AFSIM’s multi-domain modeling delivers significant and evolving capabilities to simulate key space mission areas
        ISR, SDA, RPO, PNT, SATCOM, OPIR, launch-to-orbit

ASTROLABE

    Use astrolabe to create, verify, and visualize orbital mission events and sequences
    Plan maneuvers constructively in Wizard
    Execute tactical maneuvers in real-time with Warlock
    Utilize a variety of supported orbital maneuver events
        Rendezvous, intercept, target, match velocity
        Normal, tangent, radial, plane change
        Launch insertion, hohmann transfer, circularize
    Optimize maneuvers based on time or delta-v and customize event constraints
    Specify impulsive or finite maneuvering model

CONSTELLATION MAKER

    Rapidly prototype and study constellations targeting specific mission areas
    Generate notional constellations via GUI or scripted option
        Traditional walker delta and walker star types
        Custom constellation types
    Automatically create AFSIM scenario input files to facilitate design of experiments
    Constellation members inherit all subsystems from their defining platform type
    Customize specific constellation members via the advanced generator option

RENDEZVOUS & PROXIMITY OPERATIONS (RPO)

    Explore AFSIM’s expanded space-domain visualizations for RPO to mission plan and understand the playing field
    Visualize relative orbit systems using tracks (perception) or truth
    Compute relative metrics on the fly between a target HVA and chaser satellites
    Tile radial, in-track, and cross-track (RIC) planes of interest relative to selected HVAs
    Display dynamic data of concern on any satellite tether view window

AFSIM COVERAGE

    Study sensor coverage of notional or existing ISR constellations
    Define coverage grids of various kinds (terrestrial, GEO belt)
    Select coverage assets from existing platforms or platform templates
    Collect a wide variety of measures of effectiveness
        Including: coverage time, revisit time, asset coverage, access duration
    Generate reports in multiple formats
    Visualize results with integrated overlay in Wizard, Warlock, and Mystic

SPACE ENVIRONMENT, SENSORS, & SIGNATURES

    Simulate the space environment
        Satellite signatures – RF, IR, and optical
        Orbital conjunction prediction and avoidance
        Collision and debris modeling
    Conduct space domain awareness (SDA) analysis with expanded cislunar modeling
        Model space surveillance network sensors
        Use multi-type data fusion to track and update perceived states of space objects
        Employ AFSIM’s flexible, extensible, and accurate integrating propagator
        Create scenarios around central bodies other than earth
