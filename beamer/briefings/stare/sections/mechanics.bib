@book{analyticMechanics,
	abstract = {Analytical Mechanics, first published in 1999, provides a detailed introduction to the key analytical techniques of classical mechanics, one of the cornerstones of physics. It deals with all the important subjects encountered in an undergraduate course and prepares the reader thoroughly for further study at graduate level. The authors set out the fundamentals of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics early on in the book and go on to cover such topics as linear oscillators, planetary orbits, rigid-body motion, small vibrations, nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and special relativity. A special feature is the inclusion of many 'e-mail questions', which are intended to facilitate dialogue between the student and instructor. Many worked examples are given, and there are 250 homework exercises to help students gain confidence and proficiency in problem-solving. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses in classical mechanics, and provides a sound foundation for graduate study.},

	abstract = {Large space structures would exhibit orbit-attitude-structure-thermal coupled effects in complicated space environment. Thus, a new thermal-structure coupled modelling method is proposed using gradient-deficient absolute nodal coordinate formulation beam elements. Compared to the previous methods, both axial and circumferential heat conduction are considered. The cubic interpolation in temperature field instead of the linear interpolation is adopted to obtain a unified-mesh temperature-displacement description. The gravitational force and gravity gradient are modelled, and the effects of attitude motion and structural deformation on solar radiation intensity are considered. In addition, three kinds of quasi-static thermal-structure coupled models are proposed based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Based on the quasi-static models, the theoretical formulas are derived to effectively predict the thermally induced vibrations of the beam in space. Four numerical examples are studied to validate the proposed models, including the heat conduction examples with three boundary conditions and a thermal-structure coupled cantilever beam example. Based on the proposed formulation, the orbit-attitude-structure-thermal coupled dynamics of a multibody system consisted of a rigid body and a large flexible appendage is investigated considering the gravity gradient, solar radiation, Earth's shadow, and self-shadow.},

	abstract = {The mechanism that forms the different resonant families of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars is not completely understood. To study the resonant capture mechanism and the origin of orbits of some asteroid families in mean motion resonances with Jupiter, furthermore to give a possible explanation of this problem, we performed in situ numerical simulations of the 3-dimensional semi-analytical model of the Sun-Jupiter-particle system. We examined the numbers and orbits of particles captured along the Jupiter's present orbit (including the L3, L4 and L5 Lagrange points) for 7000 Jupiter years. In our simulations we did not distinguish between planetesimals, interplanetary dust and asteroids, because we investigated the restricted three-body problem taking into account only gravitation. We found that the asteroid families in 4:3, 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 5:8, 4:7 and 5:9 resonances may have formed from the asteroids captured, launched and kept on their orbits not only by the L4 and L5 points, but also by the unstable L3 point and certain areas along the Jupiter's path. Furthermore, we found possible new asteroid families in 4:5 and 3:4 resonances, no any member of which have yet been identified. Thus, Jupiter forms a shield which protects the inner Solar System from asteroids moving with speeds not significantly differing from that of Jupiter.},

Collisions between these objects have already occurred and pose a potential threat in the future, resulting in the creation of countless debris fragments. In particular, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region is densely populated and highly contested. This underscores the critical importance of space surveillance in this area. Moreover, the utilization of Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) is also on the rise. To ensure the safety and functionality of operational satellites, it is paramount to accurately determine and continuously monitor the orbits of space objects, mitigating the risk of collisions. Precise and timely predictions of future trajectories are essential for this purpose. In response to these challenges, this survey paper provides a comprehensive review of various methods proposed in the literature for Orbit Determination (OD). It also identifies research gaps and suggests potential directions for future studies, emphasizing the pressing need for adequate Space Situational Awareness (SSA).},

An extended numerical analysis on the deputy satellite motion is performed, where the initial state vector of deputy satellite and eccentricity of chief satellite are used as initial conditions for finding its own periodic orbits. The interior loops of periodic orbits are obtained using numerical integrator RKEOM. Such orbits are analysed for different parameters and their stability are also discussed, where these orbits have considerable importance in the resonance analysis of motion The second zonal harmonic coefficient effect on the periodicity, initial position, initial true anomaly is studied, alongside exploring these orbits with one, two and three loops.

	abstract = {Classical methods for initial orbit determination (IOD) include Laplace method, Gauss method, and their variations. In addition to this, based on the characteristic of optical observation data nowadays, experts propose some other IOD methods, like Double-r method and admissible region method. One of the ways to determinate the orbit through double-r method is to guess distances of the target from the observer at two epochs---usually at the first and the last one. By doing so, we can solve the Lambert problem, and use its solution as the initial guess of the orbit. Furthermore, we can improve the initial guess by iterations to reduce the root mean square (RMS) of the observations. The admissible method is based on the concept of attributable (longitude, latitude, and their rates). With some conceptions, the admissible region described by the range and range rate from the observer is characterized. Using triangulation we can find the nodal point that makes the RMS minimal. In our work, we apply one intelligent optimization method---the particle swarm optimization method to the two methods, based on simulated and real data, and compare the results with that of modified Laplace method. At last, we briefly discuss the possibility of applying the double-r method to the orbit link problem.},

	abstract = {The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) has been directly applied to the motion of (macroscopic) test bodies on a given space-time in order to compute corrections to the classical orbits predicted in Newtonian Mechanics or General Relativity. These corrections generically violate the Equivalence Principle. The GUP has also been indirectly applied to the gravitational source by relating the GUP modified Hawking temperature to a deformation of the background metric. Such a deformed background metric determines new geodesic motions without violating the Equivalence Principle. We point out here that the two effects are mutually exclusive when compared with experimental bounds. Moreover, the former stems from modified Poisson brackets obtained from a wrong classical limit of the deformed canonical commutators.},

	abstract = {Orbital uncertainty propagation plays an important role in space situational awareness related missions such as tracking and data association, conjunction assessment, sensor resource management and anomaly detection. Linear models and Monte Carlo simulation were primarily used to propagate uncertainties. However, due to the nonlinear nature of orbital dynamics, problems such as low precision and intensive computation have greatly hampered the application of these methods. Aiming at solving these problems, many nonlinear uncertainty propagators have been proposed in the past two decades. To motivate this research area and facilitate the development of orbital uncertainty propagation, this paper summarizes the existing linear and nonlinear uncertainty propagators and their associated applications in the field of orbital mechanics. Frameworks of methods for orbital uncertainty propagation, the advantages and drawbacks of different methods, as well as potential directions for future efforts are also discussed.},

In this paper, the existence and stability of the periodic orbits induced by the grazing bifurcation in a cantilever beam system with impacts are uncovered. Firstly, the Poincar{\'e} mapping of the system is obtained by adopting the discontinuous mapping method. Then, by means of shooting method, the periodic orbits are determined, followed by the acquisition of Jacobian matrix in the case of non-impact is obtained subsequently. In addition, for various impacting patterns, a combination of inhomogeneous equations and inequations is obtained to determine the existence of period orbits after grazing, with the stability criterion of the grazing-induced periodic orbits given. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis. What is more, we also give a conjecture about the relationship between eigenvalues and the type of periodic orbits when eigenvalues are imaginary numbers.},

The cosine angle between geomagnetic field vector and target direction vector, as viewed from the satellite, provides some quantity that is sensitive to satellite position, more regular and periodical than the magnetic field magnitude as a satellite moves around its orbit, and easily observable from magnetometers. An algorithm is formulated by applying the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based on the laws of orbital mechanics, the measurement models of geomagnetic field magnitude and the cosine angle. The algorithm is tested and verified by using real-flight data obtained from Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-1 (KOMPSAT-1) and Magnetic Field Satellite (MAGSAT). The results obtained from numerical simulations using KOMPSAT-1 and MAGSAT data illustrate the significant convergence speed up and the robustness against both noise and bias of magnetic measurements. The proposed orbit determination is adequate as a primary routine for a target pointing satellite mission that requires fast convergence. Otherwise, it is sufficient as a secondary routine to provide redundancy.},

	abstract = {The old quantum theory and Schr{\"o}dinger׳s wave mechanics (and other forms of quantum mechanics) give the same results for the line splittings in the first-order Stark effect in hydrogen, the leading terms in the splitting of the spectral lines emitted by a hydrogen atom in an external electric field. We examine the account of the effect in the old quantum theory, which was hailed as a major success of that theory, from the point of view of wave mechanics. First, we show how the new quantum mechanics solves a fundamental problem that one runs into in the old quantum theory with the Stark effect. It turns out that, even without an external field, it depends on the coordinates in which the quantum conditions are imposed which electron orbits are allowed in a hydrogen atom. The allowed energy levels and hence the line splittings are independent of the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the orbits are not. In the new quantum theory, this worrisome non-uniqueness of orbits turns into the perfectly innocuous non-uniqueness of bases in Hilbert space. Second, we review how the so-called WKB (Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin) approximation method for solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation reproduces the quantum conditions of the old quantum theory amended by some additional half-integer terms. These extra terms remove the need for some arbitrary extra restrictions on the allowed orbits that the old quantum theory required over and above the basic quantum conditions.},

To achieve this objective, we conduct a comprehensive survey by systematically classifying the initial conditions of trajectories and scanning the phase space using two-dimensional (2D) maps on various planes. We then numerically integrate the starting conditions on these maps and classify the final states of the test particles as either bounded or unbounded. Bounded orbits are further subclassified as collision orbits and regular (or chaotic), while unbounded orbits are sub-classified according to the sector of the (x,y) plane through which the particle escapes the potential well. Our results reveal that increasing values of the oblateness coefficient reduce the number of escaping orbits and limit the extension of islands of regular motion (in the Liouville--Arnold sense). Regular bounded motion occurs only at larger distances from the secondary body.},

	abstract = { Abstract. We propose a scheme for data-driven parameterization of unresolved dimensions of dynamical systems based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining a surrogate system in a time-dependent quantum state which determines the fluxes from the unresolved degrees of freedom at each timestep. The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes' law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 multiscale systems and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic dynamics. },

	abstract = { Abstract. We consider the fluid-structure interaction of viscoelastic solids and Stokesian multiphase fluid flows with moving capillary interfaces and investigate the impact of moving contact lines. Thermodynamic consistency of Lagrangian diffuse and sharp-interface models is ensured even on the discrete level by providing a monolithic incremental time discretization and a finite element space discretization. We numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero, \(\varepsilon \to 0\), and investigate scalings of the Cahn--Hilliard mobility \(m(\varepsilon )=m\_0\varepsilon^\alpha\) for \(0\le \alpha \le \infty\). In the presence of interfaces, certain sharp-interface limits are only valid for an interval \(\underline{\alpha }\lt \alpha \lt \overline{\alpha }\), i.e., there is an upper and lower bound on the range of valid scaling exponents \(\alpha\). We show that with moving contact lines scaling is more restrictive since \(\alpha \approx \underline{\alpha }\) causes significant errors due to excess diffusion. Similarly, we demonstrate that \(\alpha \gt \bar \alpha\) leads to nonconvergence to the sharp-interface limit. We propose \(2\le \alpha \le 5/2\) as a range of exponents that ensure optimal convergence of the phase field dynamics towards the sharp interface dynamics as \(\varepsilon \to 0\). },

A variable-length pendulum model is employed to describe the purely out-of-plane tether deployment dynamics, from which an analytical tether deployment control law is derived. The stability condition of the analytical control law is examined by Floquet theory. The corresponding analytical deployment law is asymptotically stable, and the requirement for a positive tension control input is guaranteed to ensure the controllability of the tether system. Following deployment, the critical conditions for the out-of-plane libration of the tethered subsatellite to become chaotic during the station-keeping phase are examined. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed approach can effectively and rapidly identify periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic motions using bifurcation diagrams, which provides valuable insights for enhancing the stability and reliability of such tethered satellite systems.},

@article{LIU2024109269,
	abstract = {For non-cooperative large tumbling space debris, the use of detumbling techniques to reduce its angular velocity facilitates capturing and deorbiting operations. In our recent work, a new detumbling device combining three harpoons and a nanosatellite was designed. The device is released from the servicing satellite and attaches to the surface of the target. Then, the device's thrusters are actuated to reduce the target's angular velocity. In this paper, the dynamics and control issues involved in this strategy are further investigated. The collision model between the detumbling device and the target in the process of attachment is built based on the principle of momentum conservation. A high-precision orbit-attitude coupled dynamics model of the combined system during the detumbling mission is established, in which major external disturbances as well as inertial parameter variations due to the fuel consumption of the nanosatellite are taken into account. In addition, an adaptive sliding mode control scheme incorporating pulse-width pulse-frequency (PWPF) modulation is proposed for debris targets with parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the detumbling control scheme are demonstrated by numerical simulations. The results show that the detumbling device is capable of detumbling a large tumbling rocket upper stage within 4000s.},
