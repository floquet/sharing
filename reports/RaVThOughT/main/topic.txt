I couldn't locate specific information on the "Radial Alignment and Vectorized Thrust Orientation in Time (RaVThOughT) frame" in publicly available sources. This concept appears to be novel or proprietary, possibly detailed in internal documents or recent research not yet widely disseminated.

However, the challenges you've described—particularly the nonlinear coupling between thrust actions and orbital motion—are well-recognized in spacecraft guidance and control. Traditional reference frames, such as the Local-Vertical Local-Horizontal (LVLH) frame, are commonly used to model relative motion between spacecraft. For instance, the Hill frame, a type of LVLH frame, is often employed to represent the relative motion of spacecraft orbiting Earth.

Additionally, there has been research into developing "flyable" guidance and control algorithms that address the complexities of spacecraft maneuvers. These algorithms aim to provide low computational effort, low fuel consumption, and high safety and robustness, which are crucial for effective autonomous control.

Given the lack of publicly available information on the RaVThOughT frame, I recommend consulting the document provided by your coworker for detailed insights. If further clarification is needed, reaching out to the author or presenter of the document could provide more context and understanding of this novel approach.

If you have specific questions or need assistance with related concepts in spacecraft guidance and control, feel free to ask!
