\begin{abstract}
Modern Fortran is a powerful language for high-performance computing (HPC) and numerical analysis, offering features specifically designed for scientific and engineering applications. Its support for advanced numerics, such as high-precision arithmetic and robust intrinsic functions, makes it ideal for solving complex mathematical problems. With built-in tools for vectorization and array operations, Fortran enables concise, efficient code for handling large datasets. Coarrays introduce a simple yet effective parallel programming model, allowing developers to harness distributed-memory architectures with ease. Additionally, modern Fortran integrates seamlessly with C and Python, ensuring interoperability and access to extensive ecosystems. These features, combined with decades of optimization for numerical workloads, which makes modern Fortran a top choice.
