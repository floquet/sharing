\begin{abstract}
Coarrays are a tool to help Fortran programmers write efficient parallel code. The idea is to place the onus of the intricacies of parallel communication onto the compiler writers, leaving programmers to focus on scientific computation and methods. This paper addresses basic questions of how methods for parallel discrete event simulation might be expressed on HPC using coarrays.
