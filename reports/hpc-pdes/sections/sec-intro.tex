\subsection{Overview of the Problem}
This subsection provides a detailed description of the problem or challenge being addressed in this project.

\subsection{The Promise of Coarrays}
Portability	of performance. Can a human do better? References: \cite{numrich2018parallel, ray2019fortran}, (\cite{markus2012modern, clerman2011modern, Hanson2013}) as well as the invaluable language reference guide \cite{metcalf2024modern}.	

While we have been witness to anecdotal discusses about the performance portability of coarrays. We certainly believe that there are human programmers skilled enough in MPI who can craft code which outperforms a carry implementations

%%% Subsection B: Objectives
% -----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{PDES}
PDES references. (\cite{fujimoto1990parallel, fujimoto1993parallel, fujimoto2017parallel})

%%% Subsection C: Methodology
% -----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Methodology}
This subsection describes the methodology or approach taken to address the problem and achieve the objectives.
