@article{huang2017real,
	abstract = {The frequent maneuvering of BeiDou Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites affects the availability of real-time orbit, and decreases the accuracy and performance of positioning, navigation and time (PNT) services. BeiDou satellite maneuver information cannot be obtained by common users. BeiDou broadcast ephemeris is the only indicator of the health status of satellites, which are broadcast on an hourly basis, easily leading to ineffective observations. Sometimes, identification errors of satellite abnormity also appear in the broadcast ephemeris. This study presents a real-time robust detection method for a satellite orbital maneuver with high frequency and high reliability. By using the broadcast ephemeris and pseudo-range observations, the time discrimination factor and the satellite identification factor were defined and used for the real-time detection of start time and the pseudo-random noise code (PRN) of satellites was used for orbital maneuvers. Data from a Multi-GNSS Experiment (MGEX) was collected and analyzed. The results show that the start time and the PRN of the satellite orbital maneuver could be detected accurately in real time. In addition, abnormal start times and satellite abnormities caused by non-maneuver factors also could be detected using the proposed method. The new method not only improves the utilization of observations for users with the data effective for about 92 min, but also promotes the reliability of real-time PNT services.},

@article{he2013experimental,
	abstract = {The regional service of the Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system is now in operation with a constellation including five Geostationary Earth Orbit satellites (GEO), five Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit (IGSO) satellites and four Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. Besides the standard positioning service with positioning accuracy of about 10 m, both precise relative positioning and precise point positioning are already demonstrated. As is well known, precise orbit and clock determination is essential in enhancing precise positioning services. To improve the satellite orbits of the BeiDou regional system, we concentrate on the impact of the tracking geometry and the involvement of MEOs, and on the effect of integer ambiguity resolution as well. About seven weeks of data collected at the BeiDou Experimental Test Service (BETS) network is employed in this experimental study. Several tracking scenarios are defined, various processing schemata are designed and carried out; and then, the estimates are compared and analyzed in detail. The results show that GEO orbits, especially the along-track component, can be significantly improved by extending the tracking network in China along longitude direction, whereas IGSOs gain more improvement if the tracking network extends in latitude. The involvement of MEOs and ambiguity-fixing also make the orbits better.},

@article{du2019novel,
	abstract = {Transmission link disturbances and device failure cause global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers to miss observations, leading to poor accuracy in real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. Previously described solutions for this problem are influenced by the length of the prediction period, or are unable to account for changes in receiver state because they use information from previous epochs to make predictions. We propose an algorithm for predicting double difference (DD) observations of obstructed BeiDou navigation system (BDS) GEO satellites. Our approach adopts the first-degree polynomial function for predicting missing observations. We introduce a Douglas-Peucker algorithm to judge the state of the rover receiver to reduce the impact of predictive biases. Static and kinematic experiments were carried out on BDS observations to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal < 2 cm, vertical < 18 cm). Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are increased by 47% and 27% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing data.},

@article{jaggi2016swarm,
	abstract = {The Swarm mission consists of three satellites orbiting the Earth at low orbital altitudes. The onboard GPS receivers, star cameras, and laser retro-reflectors make the Swarm mission an interesting candidate to explore the contribution of Swarm GPS data to the recovery of both the static and time-variable gravity fields. We use 1.5 years of Swarm GPS and attitude data to generate kinematic positions of high quality to perform gravity field determination using the Celestial Mechanics Approach. The generated gravity fields reveal severe systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator. Their size is correlated with the ionospheric density and thus strongly varying over the analyzed time period. Similar to the findings of the GOCE mission, the systematic errors are related to the Swarm GPS carrier phase data and may be reduced by rejecting GPS data affected by large ionospheric changes. Such a measure yields a strong reduction of the systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator in the gravity field recovery. Long wavelength signatures of the gravity field may then be recovered with a similar quality as achieved with GRACE GPS data, which makes the Swarm mission well suited to bridge a potential gap between the current GRACE and the future GRACE Follow-On mission.},

@article{montenbruck2018reduced,
	abstract = {Precise science orbits for the first 4 years of the Swarm mission have been generated from onboard GPS measurements in a systematic reprocessing using refined models and processing techniques. Key enhancements relate to the introduction of macro-models for a more elaborate non-gravitational force modeling (solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag and lift, earth albedo), as well as carrier phase ambiguity fixing. Validation using satellite laser ranging demonstrates a 30% improvement in the precision of the reduced dynamic orbits with resulting errors at the 0.5--1 cm level (1D RMS). A notable performance improvement is likewise achieved for the kinematic orbits, which benefit most from the ambiguity fixing and show a 50% error reduction in terms of SLR residuals while differences with respect to reduced dynamic ephemerides amount to only 1.7 cm (median of daily 3D RMS). Compared to the past kinematic science orbits based on float-ambiguity estimates, the new kinematic position solutions exhibit a factor of reduction of two to three in Allan deviation at time scales of 1000s and higher, and promise an improved recovery of low-degree and -order gravity field coefficients in Swarm gravity field analyses.},

@book{swatschina2012dynamic,
	abstract = {The precise positioning of satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) has become a key technology
for advanced space missions. Dedicated satellite missions, such as CHAMP, GRACE and
GOCE, that aim to map the Earth's gravity field and its variation over time with
unprecedented accuracy, initiated the demand for highly precise orbit solutions of LEO
satellites. Furthermore, a wide range of additional science opportunities opens up with the
capability to generate accurate LEO orbits. For all considered satellite missions, the primary
measurement system for navigation is a spaceborne GPS receiver. The goal of this thesis is to
establish and implement methods for Precise Orbit Determination (POD) of LEO satellites
using GPS. Striving for highest precision using yet efficient orbit generation strategies, the
attained orbit solutions are aimed to be competitive with the most advanced solutions of
other institutions.
Dynamic and reduced-dynamic orbit models provide the basic concepts of this work. These
orbit models are subsequently adjusted to the highly accurate GPS measurements. The GPS
measurements are introduced at the zero difference level in the ionosphere free linear
combination. Appropriate procedures for GPS data screening and editing are established to
detect erroneous data and to employ measurements of good quality only. For the dynamic
orbit model a sophisticated force model, especially designed for LEO satellites, has been
developed. In order to overcome the limitations that are induced by the deficiencies of the
purely dynamical model, two different types of empirical parameters are introduced into the
force model. These reduced-dynamic orbit models allow for the generation of much longer
orbital arcs while preserving the spacecraft dynamics to the most possible extent. The two
methods for reduced-dynamic orbit modeling are instantaneous velocity changes (pulses) or
piecewise constant accelerations. For both techniques highly efficient modeling algorithms
are presented. The additional parameters are estimated within the adjustment process. In
order to regulate their impact on the dynamic solution, the empirical parameters are
assigned statistical a priori information. This allows for a perfect synergy of the advanced
knowledge of spacecraft dynamics and the high accuracy of the GPS measurements.
The developed routines have been implemented in a computer program and tested for
CHAMP and GRACE. The applied strategies proved to be highly efficient, robust and flexible.
The attained orbit solutions are validated against solutions of other well-established POD
methods. It is shown, that dynamic POD delivers accuracies at the 1 dm level for orbital
lengths of up to 90 minutes. Furthermore, employing an adequate number of pseudostochastic parameters with optimal weighting, reduced-dynamic orbit determination is a
powerful strategy for LEO POD. Orbital arcs over a whole day can be generated with an
accuracy of up to 4.5 cm RMS. },

@article{andreis2004orbit,
	abstract = {Full quaternions constitute a compact notation for describing the motion of a body in the space. An important result about full quaternions is that they can be partitioned into a unit quaternion (which describes the orientation with respect to a suitable reference), and a modulus (which represents the translational motion along the direction indicated by the unit quaternion). Since vectors and scalars are also fullquaternions, the equations of body motion can be rewritten in quaternion form. In this paper the orbit dynamics and kinematics of a point mass moving in the space are transformed in quaternion form. Simple application examples are presented.},

@article{visser2003aiming,
	abstract = {The computation of high-accuracy orbits is a prerequisite for the success of Low Earth Orbiter (LEO) missions such as CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE. The mission objectives of these satellites cannot be reached without computing orbits with an accuracy at the few cm level. Such a level of accuracy might be achieved with the techniques of reduced-dynamic and kinematic precise orbit determination (POD) assuming continuous Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Both techniques have reached a high level of maturity and have been successfully applied to missions in the past, for example to TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P), leading to (sub-)decimeter orbit accuracy. New LEO gravity missions are (to be) equipped with advanced GPS receivers promising to provide very high quality SST observations thereby opening the possibility for computing cm-level accuracy orbits. The computation of orbits at this accuracy level does not only require high-quality GPS receivers, but also advanced and demanding observation preprocessing and correction algorithms. Moreover, sophisticated parameter estimation schemes need to be adapted and extended to allow the computation of such orbits. Finally, reliable methods need to be employed for assessing the orbit quality and providing feedback to the different processing steps in the orbit computation process.},

@article{vsvehla2003kinematic,
	abstract = {Abstract. Various methods for kinematic and reduced-dynamic precise orbit determination (POD) of Low Earth Orbiters (LEO) were developed based on zero- and double-differencing of GPS carrier-phase measurements with and without ambiguity resolution. In this paper we present the following approaches in LEO precise orbit determination: -- zero-difference kinematic POD, -- zero-difference dynamic POD, -- double-difference kinematic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- double-difference dynamic POD with and without ambiguity resolution, -- combined GPS/SLR reduced-dynamic POD. All developed POD approaches except the combination of GPS/SLR were tested using real CHAMP data (May 20-30, 2001) and independently validated with Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data over the same 11 days. With SLR measurements, additional combinations are possible and in that case one can speak of combined kinematic or combined reduced-dynamic POD. First results of such a combined GPS/SLR POD will be presented, too. This paper shows what LEO orbit accuracy may be achieved with GPS using different strategies including zerodifference and double-difference approaches. Kinematic versus dynamic orbit determination is presently an interesting issue that will also be discussed in this article.},

@article{montenbruck2002satellite,
	abstract = {This book is intended to be a ``comprehensive textbook that guides the reader through the theory and practice of satellite orbit prediction and determination.'' This reviewer believes the book does just that. However, it is stated that it is intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses, and for professionals on the job. The undergraduate would likely have to struggle with the material presented in the book for two reasons. One is that s/he would not have a sufficient background in all the areas covered, and the other is that a significant amount of material is presented in such a concise form that it does not allow one to pick up the background material from the text. The diligent student, however, could refer to the ample references provided (approximately 320) to fill in the background gaps. The author's focus is on providing material currently being used for orbit prediction and determination. (A good portion of the references are from the 1990s.) There is little, if any, discussion of analytic approaches (such as perturbation techniques) that classically have been applied to such problems. There is an extensive amount of practical information regarding force modeling, measurements and filtering, tracking, reckoning time, and computer algorithms. This information is presented in nine chapters, two appendices, and one CD.

The first chapter, entitled Around the World in a Hundred Minutes, summarizes the broad range and types of orbits encountered and has excellent color photos of some recent satellites. The second chapter, Introductory Astrodynamics, is approximately 30 pages and reviews the basic two-body theory with its implications on tracking and determining orbit characteristics. Chapter 3 devotes about 60 pages to the modeling of forces, including the higher harmonics of the gravitational field, the gravitational effects of the Sun and the Moon, Solar radiation, and atmospheric drag. In addition, some consideration is paid to precision modeling with GPS satellites in mind. Chapter 4 devotes about 40 pages to the various methods of integration for precise orbit prediction. The emphasis is on comparing accuracy and effort of the different techniques. Chapter 5 is a very nice discussion of the various time and reference systems which takes about 30 pages. Tracking and observation models are discussed in Chapter 6. These include radar and laser tracking, range, range rate, and the use of GPS signals. Chapter 7 introduces the linearization procedure to supply the required background for Chapter 8 which is Orbit Determination and Parameter Estimation. These chapters occupy about 60 pages. In this next to last chapter, the least squares and Kalman filtering methods are presented. Finally, Chapter 9 supplies three application examples using real data, including one demonstrating error analysis, real time orbit determination, and orbit determination using a relay satellite.

If that were the complete book, this reviewer would suggest that it would be a good addition to your library. However, there is more. The authors have provided a CD with some C++ codes that support all the problems at the ends of the chapters, the three application problems in Chapter 9, and in addition, have some generic satellite codes to support problems that the reader might want to attack. In this generic library are mathematical and astronomical constants, integration routines for differential equations, least squares estimation and Kalman filtering, a force model which includes a 
 gravitational model, Sun and Moon gravitational effects, appropriate coordinate transformations, calendar-time calculations, and some vector/matrix operations. The codes that support the problems at the end of each chapter help to improve the understanding of the chapter and aid readers who are doing a self study. In addition, the CD has an extensive list of website links which support most of the topics in the book and more.

Satellite Orbits: Models, Methods, and Applications would be a valuable addition to the library of any engineer or scientist interested in the practical aspects of orbit prediction and determination. There are few books currently available that cover this material under a single cover, the most recent being, Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications by DA Vallado, (McGraw Hill, 1997), which would be a good complimentary text to Satellite Orbits. The comprehensive reference list along with the CD supplied codes make this book unique in this area.},
