 abstract = {It has been proved that the use of a vector Lyapunov function is more advantageous in certain situations rather than a scalar function. Moreover, each function needs to satisfy less rigid requirements. In this paper a new situation has been considered where vector Lyapunov functions play a further useful role. For this purpose, a new type of stability, namely, strict partial stability has been defined. The principal tool employed is the second method of Lyapunov and a comparison theorem of a more general type.},
