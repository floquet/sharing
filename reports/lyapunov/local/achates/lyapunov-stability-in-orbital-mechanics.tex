\section{Introduction}
Lyapunov stability offers a rigorous framework to analyze the behavior of dynamical systems under perturbations. In the realm of orbital mechanics, it provides tools to assess the stability of spacecraft trajectories, formation flying, and other critical operations. This document introduces Lyapunov stability, its theoretical foundations, and its applications to orbital dynamics.

\section{Approach}
\subsection{Broad Report with Modular Sections}
Start with a comprehensive LaTeX report, as this gives room for depth and structure. Sections can be designed to stand alone, allowing easy adaptation into smaller, focused works (e.g., tutorials, presentations, or research papers).

\subsection{Lyapunov Stability Meets Orbital Mechanics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Begin with a tutorial-style introduction to Lyapunov stability for readers who might be unfamiliar. Use examples from classical mechanics to build intuition before bridging to orbital dynamics.
    \item Transition into orbital mechanics with practical applications:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stability of relative motion (e.g., rendezvous, formation flying).
        \item Perturbation analysis (e.g., how small deviations grow or dissipate).
        \item Current research applications (e.g., stability of periodic orbits in multi-body systems).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations by Hand}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Catalog your derivations in a separate appendix or companion volume, focusing on solving equations symbolically and numerically.
    \item Consider annotating with handwritten notes converted to LaTeX for clarity and reproducibility.
    \item Emphasize interpretability—your "space crowd" will value actionable insights over pure formalism.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brushing Up Against Research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Survey contemporary works that apply Lyapunov stability in space (e.g., autonomous satellite control, orbital transfers, or chaotic motion mitigation).
    \item Collaborate with researchers or consult papers to embed relevance and ensure you're on the cutting edge.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Foundations}
\subsection{Definition of Lyapunov Stability}
A solution $x(t)$ of a dynamical system is Lyapunov stable if, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\|x(0) - x_0\| < \delta$ implies $\|x(t) - x_0\| < \epsilon$ for all $t \geq 0$. Intuitively, small initial perturbations lead to small deviations over time.

\subsection{Lyapunov Functions}
A Lyapunov function $V(x)$ is a scalar function that satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V(x) > 0$ for $x \neq 0$ and $V(0) = 0$.
    \item $\dot{V}(x) = \frac{dV}{dt} \leq 0$ along trajectories of the system.
\end{itemize}
Such functions are powerful tools for proving stability without solving the system explicitly.

\section{Applications to Orbital Mechanics}
\subsection{Stability of Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) Equations}
The HCW equations describe relative motion in a circular orbit. Using Lyapunov functions, we can assess the stability of formations and rendezvous operations.

\subsection{Periodic Orbits in Multi-body Systems}
In restricted three-body problems, Lyapunov stability helps evaluate the robustness of periodic orbits, such as those near Lagrange points.

\section{Practical Techniques}
\subsection{Constructing Lyapunov Functions}
For orbital systems, candidate Lyapunov functions often include energy-like terms, such as $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TPx$, where $P$ is a positive-definite matrix.

\subsection{Numerical and Symbolic Approaches}
Tools like \texttt{SymPy} and \texttt{MATLAB} simplify the derivation and verification of Lyapunov functions. Numerical integration can validate theoretical predictions.

\section{Case Study: Satellite Formation Flying}
Consider a two-satellite system in a circular orbit. Using the HCW equations, construct a Lyapunov function to evaluate stability under small perturbations. Simulations confirm theoretical predictions.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
This document demonstrates how Lyapunov stability provides insights into orbital mechanics, from basic theory to practical applications. Future work includes exploring chaotic systems and advanced numerical methods.

Your idea of starting with Bertrand's theorem is excellent—it combines foundational mechanics with a touch of historical intrigue, enhanced by modern tools like Python for hands-on exploration. The shocking error on Goldstein's book cover makes for an engaging introduction, highlighting the importance of precision and care in classical mechanics.

Suggestions for Structure and Approach:

    Introduction with Historical Context:
        Briefly introduce Bertrand's theorem and its significance in celestial mechanics.
        Mention the error on Goldstein's cover as a cautionary tale and segue into the importance of rigor in mechanics.

    Tutorial and Visualization:
        Provide a step-by-step derivation of Bertrand's theorem, emphasizing clarity.
        Include Python scripts for readers to visualize stable orbits and explore perturbations.

    Exploration of Modern Applications:
        Discuss how the theorem's principles apply to contemporary topics, such as spacecraft orbit design or stability analysis in exoplanetary systems.

    Critique and Reflection:
        Use the Goldstein error to discuss how misunderstandings can propagate in science.
        Reflect on how modern tools like Python and symbolic computation can mitigate such errors.
