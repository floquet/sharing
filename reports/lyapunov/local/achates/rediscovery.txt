Your recollection is correct: Lyapunov's work on stability theory was not immediately appreciated or widely recognized after its publication. It gained prominence much later, especially during the 20th century, when the need for rigorous stability analysis emerged in fields like control theory, dynamical systems, and aerospace engineering. Here’s an overview and references related to this "rediscovery":
Historical Context

    Initial Reception:
        Lyapunov's seminal work, "The General Problem of the Stability of Motion" (1892), was initially published in Russian. This limited its accessibility to a broader audience in the early years.
        His work was primarily theoretical and ahead of its time, addressing stability in a mathematical framework that lacked immediate practical applications in late 19th-century mechanics.

    Reawakening in the 20th Century:
        The resurgence of interest in Lyapunov's work coincided with advancements in engineering and physics, particularly during the mid-20th century.
        The translation of Lyapunov’s thesis into French in 1907 and English in 1947 (Princeton Annals of Mathematics Studies) significantly contributed to its adoption in the West.
        With the advent of control theory and the study of nonlinear systems, Lyapunov’s methods became central to stability analysis.

    Applications and Recognition:
        During the 20th century, researchers in control systems and differential equations extensively applied Lyapunov’s second method (direct method) to practical problems, such as flight dynamics, electrical circuits, and orbital mechanics.
        The development of computational tools further cemented the importance of Lyapunov functions and stability criteria.
