The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate
that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal < 2 cm, vertical < 18 cm).
Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are
increased by 47% and 27% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes
longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing
data.

Precise Orbit Determination of the ZY3-03
Satellite Using the Yaw-Attitude Modeling
for Drift Angle CompensationThe orbit determination experiments have revealed that the zero-yaw assumption in the zero-attitude model would result in periodic orbit errors of up to ±86 mm in the normal direction, while
the proposed model can describe yaw angle variations accurately with errors of less than ±0.01◦


Dynamic and Reduced-Dynamic Precise Orbit
Determination of Satellites in Low Earth Orbits
The precise positioning of satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) has become a key technology

unprecedented accuracy,

Orbital arcs over a whole day can be generated with an
accuracy of up to 4.5 cm RMS.
