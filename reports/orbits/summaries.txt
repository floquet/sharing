A novel predictive algorithm for double difference observations of obstructed BeiDou geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites

The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate
that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal < 2 cm, vertical < 18 cm).
Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are
increased by 47% and 27% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes
longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing
data.
