\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
What are the current limits on the precision in computing and measuring a satellite's location? A quick literature search outlined here shows sub-meter resolution, and in some cases, centimeter resolution. This report should be read as a gateway to the literature.

\section{Introduction}
The determination of a satellite's precise orbit is crucial for various applications, from Earth observation to deep-space exploration. Recent advances in orbit determination techniques are quickly surveyed and key findings are highlighted.

\section{Literature Review}
In this section, we summarize recent studies on precise orbit determination.

The results of our navigation experiment demonstrate
that RTK positioning accuracy is improved from meter to decimeter level with fixed ambiguity (horizontal < 2 cm, vertical < 18 cm).
Horizontal accuracy is improved by over 50\%, and the vertical accuracies of the results of the static and kinematic experiments are
increased by 47\% and 27\% respectively, compared with the results produced by the classical approach. Though as the baseline becomes
longer, the accuracy is weakened, our predictive algorithm is an improvement over existing approaches to overcome the issue of missing
data.


A novel predictive algorithm for double difference observations of obstructed BeiDou geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites




Reduced dynamic and kinematic precise orbit determination
for the Swarm mission from 4 years of GPS tracking
30\% improvement in the precision of the reduced dynamic orbits with resulting errors at the 0.5--1 cm level (1D RMS)



Precise relative positioning using real tracking data from COMPASS GEO and IGSO satellites
The precision of COMPASS only solutions is better than 2 cm for the North component and 4 cm for the vertical.


Precise Orbit Determination of the ZY3-03
Satellite Using the Yaw-Attitude Modeling
for Drift Angle CompensationThe orbit determination experiments have revealed that the zero-yaw assumption in the zero-attitude model would result in periodic orbit errors of up to ±86 mm in the normal direction, while
the proposed model can describe yaw angle variations accurately with errors of less than $\pm$0.01$^\circ$


Dynamic and Reduced-Dynamic Precise Orbit
Determination of Satellites in Low Earth Orbits
The precise positioning of satellites in Low Earth Orbits (LEO) has become a key technology
for advanced space missions. Dedicated satellite missions, such as CHAMP, GRACE and
GOCE, that aim to map the Earth’s gravity field and its variation over time with
unprecedented accuracy,

Orbital arcs over a whole day can be generated with an
accuracy of up to 4.5 cm RMS. 


Aiming at a 1-cm Orbit for Low Earth Orbiters: Reduced-Dynamic and Kinematic Precise Orbit Determination
Both techniques have reached a high level of maturity and have been successfully applied to missions in the past, for example to TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P), leading to (sub-)decimeter orbit accuracy.

A novel method for improving LEO kinematic real-time precise orbit determination with neural networks
Benefiting from this method, a promising accuracy of 3.2 cm can be achieved in LEO KRTPOD


Precise orbit determination for low Earth orbit satellites using GNSS: Observations, models, and methods
Using a state-of-the-art combination of GNSS observations and satellite dynamics, the absolute orbit determination for a single satellite reached a precision of 1 cm.

From the website:
\begin{quotation}
New orbital perturbations (e.g. Poynting-Robertson effect, solar radiation pressure, outgassing) to improve the propagator accuracy and to allow the identification and propagation of any celestial body (not only NEOs but also moons, comets, planets, etc.).
The pre-existing algorithms were further improved in order to increase the performance and reduce the need for human intervention. Robust and redundant preliminary orbit determination techniques were added in order to deal with very long and disrupted observational arcs, which usually would require a manual split of the observations.

\subsection{OPI - Orbital Propagation Interface}
\begin{quotation}
\href{https://github.com/Space-Systems/OPI}{OPI} is an interface with the goal to facilitate the implementation of orbital propagators into different applications.

To calculate orbital motion, many different software programs exist emphasizing on different aspects such as execution speed or accuracy. They often require different input parameters and are written in different languages. This makes comparing or exchanging them a challenging task. OPI aims at simplifying this by providing a common way of handling propagation. Propagators using OPI are designed as plugins/shared libraries that can be loaded by a host program via the interface.
