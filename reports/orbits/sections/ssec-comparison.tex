\subsection{Comparison of Orbit Propagators}
\input{tables/table-propagators} % Reference the table file here

\subsection{Complementary Tools}
In addition to orbit propagators, complementary tools such as NASA's SPICE toolkit and Python libraries like Astropy provide valuable functionality for mission design, time conversions, and astronomical computations.

\subsection{Evaluation and Use Cases}
The choice of an orbit propagator depends on the specific mission requirements. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CubeSat missions:} Tools like FOSSASAT and Orbit Predictor are ideal for their simplicity and ease of use.
    \item \textbf{GNSS and precise orbit determination:} Orekit and ODTBX offer advanced features tailored for such applications.
    \item \textbf{Interplanetary missions:} GMAT excels in trajectory optimization for deep-space missions.
\end{itemize}
