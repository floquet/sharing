\begin{abstract}
What are the current limitations in the precision of computing and measuring satellite locations? A survey of recent literature reveals that orbit determination techniques have achieved sub-meter accuracy, with centimeter-level precision attainable under certain conditions. This report serves as a gateway to the existing body of research, providing concise summaries of key studies in satellite orbit determination. Additionally, it includes an overview of open-source orbit propagators, offering practical tools for researchers and practitioners. By presenting both state-of-the-art advancements and accessible computational resources, this report aims to bridge the gap between theoretical developments and their practical applications.
