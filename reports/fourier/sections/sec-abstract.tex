\begin{abstract}
	Spectral decomposition is a powerful method for the approximation of functions. Here we start with a decomposition using Fourier's basic functions, the sine and cosine, over an interval and then extend the analysis by using the Zernike polynomials which extend the domain to the unit disk using polynomial weighting. In a similar process using the spherical harmonic functions, the Fourier series extends the domain to the unit sphere
