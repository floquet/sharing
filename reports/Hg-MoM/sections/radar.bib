@article{lu2003comparison,
	abstract = {The surface integral equation approach and the hybrid surface-volume integral equation approach are compared for solving the problem of electromagnetic scattering by conducting objects with dielectric coating. The surface integral equation is formulated by the PMCHW method, and it is efficient for modeling bulk material scattering. The hybrid surface-volume integral equation approach is better conditioned for the volume scattering problems. For a special class of problems in which the dielectric coating is electrically thin (one to two grid sizes), the numbers of unknowns needed by the two approaches are of the same order, and the surface-volume integral equation approach converges significantly faster than the pure surface integral equation approach. Several numerical examples are given, and the results showed good agreements with the above statement.},

@book{knott2004radar,
	abstract = {Radar cross section (RCS) is a comparison of two radar signal strengths. One is the strength of the radar beam sweeping over a target, the other is the strength of the reflected echo sensed by the receiver. This book shows how the RCS gauge can be predicted for theoretical objects and how it can be measured for real targets. Predicting RCS is not easy, even for simple objects like spheres or cylinders, but this book explains the two exact forms of theory so well that even a novice will understand enough to make close predictions. Weapons systems developers are keenly interested in reducing the RCS of their platforms. The two most practical ways to reduce RCS are shaping and absorption. This book explains both in great detail, especially in the design, evaluation, and selection of radar absorbers. There is also great detail on the design and employment of indoor and outdoor test ranges for scale models or for full-scale targets (such as aircraft). In essence, this book covers everything you need to know about RCS, from what it is, how to predict and measure, and how to test targets (indoors and out), and how to beat it.},

@book{kolosov1987,
	abstract = {Over-the-Horizon Radar provides the first and only English reference on the scientific and technical fundamentals of over-the-horizon radar. In this book, top Soviet radar specialists examine the potential of high-frequency (HF) radar to enlarge operating ranges and detect targets completely obscured by the horizon. The authors' rigorous treatment of the propagation, path loss, cross section capability, and interference characteristics of OTH radar makes this book indispensable for engineers new to conventional radar or the OTH field. Over 300 equations and 188 diagrams clarify the text's range-enhancing procedures.},
