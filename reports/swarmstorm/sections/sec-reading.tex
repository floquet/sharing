\section{Fortran Readings}
The best reference for Fortran is the \emph{Modern Fortran Explained} series \cite{metcalf2024modern} by Metcalf, Reid, Cohen, and Bader. This is a living document writing by members of the Fortran Standards committee and evolves in lock step with the language.

The next two books demonstrate a careful attention to teaching through example. Clerman and Spector's book \emph{Modern fortran: building efficient parallel applications} \cite{clerman2011modern} is written around a didactic example of a tsunami simulation. Curic's book \emph{Modern fortran: building efficient parallel applications}  \cite{curcic2020modern} is a more typical approach use a broad array of examples.

The book by Hanson and Tompkins, \emph{Numerical computing with modern fortran} \cite{Hanson2013}, is a brief book with many useful insights on the practical numerics with Fortran.

Parallel programming with co-arrays \cite{numrich2018parallel}, Fortran 2018 with parallel programming \cite{ray2019fortran}
