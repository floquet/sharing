\section{Introduction}
SwarmStorm employs intrinsic Fortran tools to simulate the dynamic interactions of satellite constellations. The program leverages coarrays to distribute workload across multiple processors efficiently, enabling detailed simulations of satellite parameters, resource management, and orbital dynamics. This report highlights key features of the program, focusing on its object-oriented design and the application of coarrays.
