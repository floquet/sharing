%This document explores the application of Fortran coarrays to simulate satellite engagements. By leveraging coarrays' parallelism and synchronization capabilities, the simulation models packs of satellites as coarray images and individual satellites as coarray indices. The report briefly outlines the foundational principles, architectural considerations, and implementation details of this innovative approach.

SwarmStorm is a Fortran-based multiprocessor simulation for satellite interactions, leveraging coarray technology to enable efficient parallel computation. This report outlines the critical features of the program, including its object-oriented design with the `satellite` type and its operations, and demonstrates how coarrays streamline distributed memory computations in the context of satellite simulations.
